<p>In 1995 a working group, called <i>Anaphe</i>,
consisting of representatives of IT Division's ASD Group and of the
various LHC experiments, was created to investigate how the
approximate equivalent of the current CERNLIB environment could be
provided in the LHC era. Although the primary objectives of the
discussions concentrated on proposing solutions for future LHC
experiments, it is essential that other HEP experiments which are
coming online in the next couple of years will also be able to benefit
from the proposed strategy.</p>
<p>It is clear that (industry) standard solutions should be used
whenever possible. This is nothing new since in the past commercial
libraries or programs, such as GKS/GTS, Numerical Algorithms Group
(NAG) libraries, Phigs, Historian, and CMZ) have been used in the
CERNLIB environment.  Intensive investment of manpower should only be
made in HEP-specific developments, where the needed functionality
cannot be obtained <i>off the shelf</i> at affordable
prices. An instance of such a HEP development is the CLHEP class
library, which is also a nice example of reuse.</p>
<p>Working closely with the LHC collaborations and other HEP
Laboratories in 1996 and 1997 an interim strategy was defined and a
number of licences for the commercial components was obtained.  When
several <i>a priori</i> solutions were available, a study was made
to determine which was the most suited in the HEP context.  We also
tested the proposed solutions at a few sites and ensured that it is a
workable environment.</p>
