</h2>
<p>
Most new HEP experiments assume that it will be possible to make both
raw data and reconstructed data available <i>on-line</i> thanks to
the integration between Objectivity/DB and HPSS. Each experiment will
have its own data model and physicists should be able to
<i>navigate</i> through it. This is a major problem for a
general-purpose Interactive Analysis environment, since, unlike the
Ntuple case, there no longer exists a common and pre-defined data
model shared amongst all experiments. This problem can be solved but there
is no easy way out: the general-purpose tool should be able to access
the arbitrary experiment data model using some kind of run time type
information or the initial data model definition.


</p>
<p>
Since all data is supposed to be <i>on-line</i>, the role of the Ntuple
replacement could be quite different. While reasonably small
<i>personal</i> data collections will still exist, the main concern
will probably be how to index large event stores to speed up the
analysis. 
</p>
<p>
The RD45 Project suggested one approach to deal with both problems.
The idea it to speed up queries by defining for each event a <i>Tag</i>, 
i.e., a small collection of its most important physics attributes plus
an association with the event where the Tag data come from. Such
<i>Concrete</i> Tags contain copies of data members of a 
persistent data class. A collection of tag objects 
is saved together in a Tag Database, something 
intermediate between an Event Directory and an Ntuple.
Since they are globally defined for the whole experiment, concrete
tags can be optimized so that they offer a very efficient way to make
initial cuts on attributes, thus achieving a high degree of
selectivity.  On top of that, at any moment you are able to cross the
association to the event if you want to retrieve any other details
about the full event, which are not contained in the Tag (see bottom
part of Figure <a href="ch02.html#NTUPLETAGDB">Figure 2.1.</a>).









</p>
<p>
The <i>top part</i> of the figure shows schematically
the present <i>traditional</i> approach. The event data
(raw, reconstructed events, calibration constants, etc.) are
represented at the left hand side . They are distributed over many
files residing on various hosts.  An <i>ad-hoc</i>
program reads a set of interesting quantities in these files and
writes the retrieved information into an Ntuple file.  In this Ntuple
file data are reclustered most of the time according to a simple table
structure (more complex arrangements are, of course, possible). As the
Ntuple file format is known, interactive visualisation programs can
efficiently read these data files, thus allowing a fast and convenient
physics data analysis system to be set up. Note, however, that these
Ntuple files are completely disconnected from the original data, so
that it is impossible to automatically update in the Ntuple files
information which changes in the original. Also, it is not possible to
retrieve transparently from the original files data which were not
saved in the Ntuple when it was created.
</p>
<p>
The <i>lower part</i> of the picture figure what the
situation looks like in the Tag model. In this case often-used data
are once more reclustered (using experiment-wide concrete tags or
user-defined generic tags), but all data remain inside the same
federated database, and there exists a bidirectional link between the
reclustered and the original data. In this way, when the original data
are reprocessed, it is trivial to update the tag data, so that they
remain always up-to-date.  Conversely, when for a given event the
information in the tag database is not sufficient, then the link to
the complete event data allows you to retrieve the supplementary
information in a convenient and straighforward way <i>on the
fly</i>.



</p>
<p>
In general the selection of <i>key</i> attributes characterising 
events will be made by the experiment or group, so that concrete tags
are mostly defined for experiment-wide or
workgroup-wide data sets. However, individual physicists have
the possibility to define their own simpler data collection by using
the <i>Generic Tag</i> mechanism. This second light-weight procedure
allows you to define a tag <i>on the fly</i>, without creating a
persistent class. Compared to the concrete tag, there is, of course, a
small performance penalty, but this is most of the time balanced by
an increased flexibility, since at any time new fields can be added to
the tag and the association to the complete event data remains
available. Presently, both the concrete tag
and the generic tag are defined in a C++ program before being
used in the Interactive Analysis framework.
