<A NAME="H1AccessOBJDatabase">4. Accessing the Objectivity/DB database</A>
</H1>


<H2>4.1. What does the user have to know about the database?</H2>

<P>
Ideally, the hierarchical structure of the data storage should be
completely transparent to the average user. Therefore, the LHC++ Team
has done its best to hide the impact of the database on the C++
user code to a minimum. However, it is best that the users of the
modules are aware of some basic principles, and how they relate to the
experimental data model used by the various analysis programs.
</P>

<P>
Let we have a look at Figure <a href="H1AccessOBJDatabase.html#STORAGEUSER">[STORAGEUSER]</a>.
It shows the storage hierarchy used to store event data at the
left, together with the user's view of these data at the right.
</P>

<P CLASS="CENTERP">
<A NAME="STORAGEUSER"><IMG SRC="storage_user.gif"></A>
</P>
<P>
<B>The storage hierarchy and the user view</B>
</P>


<P>
We start with the user's view (right hand side of the picture).
The user likes to think in terms of events (the octagons), and wants
to deal with, for instance reconstructed tracks (the triangles), hits in
the forward calorimeter (the diamonds), or the calibration for the TPC
(the pentagons), etc. Users should not be directly concerned (apart
perhaps for efficiency considerations) how these various data elements
are actually stored in files and distributed over a network. They
prefer to have a <EM>logical</EM> view of their event and navigate
between its various componenents in a transparent way. It is up to the
data administrator to make sure that the data are stored in a way
optimising performance and throughput for the end user.
</P>

<P>
This is possible using an object oriented database system, such as
Objectivity/DB (left hand side of the picture). All data are kept in one
<EM>federated database</EM>, which is basically just a file containing
the catalog of the database files and the hostnames where they
reside. It also contains the <EM>schema</EM> (object model) used by
the data in the various databases.



</P>

<P>
The <EM>databases</EM> themselves are also separate files, which can
reside on different nodes and they can consist of multiple
<EM>containers</EM>, that can be thought of a contiguous areas on a
file.
</P>



<P>
Finally, each container consists of one or more <EM>persistent</EM>
objects (e.g., histograms, reconstructed tracks, fits). As seen in the
picture, the mapping of the event to its components is very flexible,
allowing different parts of an event to reside in different
containers, and/or databases (even on remote nodes). Moreover, since
the end users only access the full data through the logical structure,
they are never affected by changes in the physical layout of the
database.
</P>




<H2>4.2. Getting access to an Objectivity/DB database</H2>

<P>
In 1999 a central service will be run for the various experiments using Objectivity/DB
to provide access to their databases
from various platforms using AMS. However, at present, it is necessary to
associate a federated database with a given machine, so that you must
always connect to that same machine if you want to access that
database.





</P>

<P>
In particular, when working on a cluster (such as hpplus) you must
remember the real node name (e.g., <TT>hpplus16</TT>, as in the
example in the previous chapter) of the machine which you used to
create the database.  When you want to use the database in a later
session, you must always connect to that node, otherwise you will not
be able to access your data (unless your experiment is running Objectivity/DB's
AMS, a facility to share databases
across the network).</P>


<P>
The first step (after creating the database) is to tell Objectivity/DB
where it can be found. This is done with the environment variable
<TT>OO_FD_BOOT</TT>, which should be set to the full path name
of the boot file of the database that you want to access.  This boot
file is actually a small ASCII file, which contains valuable
information about your federated database.





</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
&gt; more $OO_FD_BOOT 
ooFDNumber=30500
ooLFDNumber=65535
ooPageSize=8192
ooLockServerName=hpplus16
ooFDDBHost=hpplus16
ooFDDBFileName=/afs/cern.ch/user/g/goossens/HP-UX/explorer/HEPEXP.FDDB
ooJNLHost=hpplus16
ooJNLPath=/afs/cern.ch/user/g/goossens/HP-UX/explorer
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>You should <EM>NEVER</EM> change its contents!</P>
<P>
In particular, changing the path of the federated database in this
file after you moved it will <EM>not</EM> work.



</P>

<P>
Once the <TT>OO_FD_BOOT</TT> variable is set correctly, you can
run the Objectivity/DB management tools. For instance the program
<TT>oodumpcatalog</TT> displays the catalog, showing the different
databases associated to the current federated database.

FD Name   = HEPEXP
FD ID     = 30500
FD File   = hpplus16::/afs/cern.ch/user/g/goossens/HP-UX/explorer/HEPEXP.FDDB
Boot File = hpplus16::/afs/cern.ch/user/g/goossens/HP-UX/explorer/HEPEXP

</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Thus, in the example above, we see that we need to connect to the node
<TT>hpplus16</TT> (the so-called <EM>Lock Host</EM>).  It should also
be noted that each federated database should have a different
federated database number to enforce proper locking management when
the same lockserver is used by more than one federation (e.g., when
the lockserver is running on a central service, such as hpplus).  A
series of federated database numbers have been allocated to
experiments and user groups (a proposed list can be found at the URL 
<A HREF="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/cernlib/rd45/recommendations/dba.html">here</A>
). As explained above, when registering as
a database user with your experiment's or group's Objectivity/DB's coordinator,
you get a unique number assigned to ensure the uniqueness of the
federated database number.



</P>




<H2>
<A NAME="H2AccesssOBJ">4.3. Accessing the Objectivity/DB from inside a C++ program</A>
</H2>

<P>After the initial installation, you have a federated database,
which has no associated databases yet. This can
be seen by using the Objectivity/DB tool <TT>ootoolmgr</TT> (<TT>oobrowse</TT>
on Windows/NT), which allows you to browse the contents of all
databases (down to the object level) in a federated database.  If you
want to run <TT>ootoolmgr</TT> just type
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
&gt; ootoolmgr
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
on the command line. You will then get an Objectivity/DB panel, as shown
in Figure <a href="H1AccessOBJDatabase.html#OOTOOLMGRPANEL">[OOTOOLMGRPANEL]</a>.




</P>

<P CLASS="CENTERP">
<A NAME="OOTOOLMGRPANEL"><IMG SRC="ootoolmgrpanel.gif"></A>
</P>
<P>
<B>The <TT>ootoolmgr</TT> initial panel</B>
</P>

<P>Then in the <TT>File</TT> pull-down menu you choose the
database (most of the time it is enough to click the default setting
at the bottom, which corresponds to the database selected with the
<TT>OO_FD_BOOT</TT> environment variable). Then you can go to
the <TT>Tools</TT> pull-down menu and choose <TT>Browse
FD</TT> at the top. Then you will see the <TT>Objectivity/DB - Browse
FD</TT> appear, with four main windows, namely the names of the
<EM>Databases</EM>, <EM>Containers</EM>, <EM>Basic
Objects</EM>, and finally, at the bottom, the contents of the
selected object. Just after initialisation, there are no databases
yet, as seen in Figure <a href="H1AccessOBJDatabase.html#OOTOOLMGREMPTY">[OOTOOLMGREMPTY]</a>.

<A NAME="OOTOOLMGREMPTY"><IMG SRC="ootoolmgrempty.gif"></A>
</P>
<P>
<B>Using the tool <TT>ootoolmgr</TT></B>
</P>



<P>
Before writing our first C++ program to use the database, let us
first establish three basic rules.
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
One must first establish a connection to the database with the
<TT>Init</TT> method.


</LI>
<LI>
<EM>Transactions</EM> are used to retrieve or store persistent
objects.

<UL>
<LI>
A transaction is set up using the <TT>startUpdate</TT>
or <TT>startRead</TT> methods.




</LI>
<LI>
A transaction is terminated using the <TT>commit</TT>
or <TT>abort</TT> methods. The <TT>commit</TT> method
will save all changed objects in the database, whereas  <TT>abort</TT>
will revert the database to the state before the transaction was
initiated.





</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>
To access persistent objects <EM>smart</EM> pointers are provided.
They are indistinguishable from normal C++ pointers, they are merely
declared with a different syntax using <TT>HepRef</TT>, e.g.,
for a 1D histogram we would declare

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
HepRefP(Histo1D) myHisto (...);
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
while for a pointer to a non-persistent C++ object you would write
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
Histo1D *myHisto ...
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Once you have declared your smart pointers to your persistent object,
all navigation between objects is completely like in the case of
normal pointers; whenever a reference is made to a smart pointer, a
callback to the database will automatically fetch the required
data. Moreover at the end of the transaction all modified objects will
automatically be stored in the database at commit time.

</LI>
</OL>
<P>If, while reading through the examples, you want to know more
details about the HepODBMS classes, you can have a look at the
<EM>Class Reference Guide</EM> at the URL
<A HREF="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/HepODBMS/reference-manual/HepODBMS.html">here</A>.

<H2>4.4. Manipulating the Objectivity/DB database and its containers in a C++ program</H2>

<P>
To show a few more of the class methods available to manipulate an
Objectivity/DB database, we can look at the following code.
</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="LISTING">
<PRE>
/* dbAccess.cpp */
#include "HepODBMS/tagdb/HepTagDbApplication.h"
#include "HepODBMS/tagdb/HepEvent.h"

class dbAccessApp : public HepTagDbApplication {
  // Application inherits session control from HepDbApplication
public:
  // this application implements just one method: run the 
  dbAccessApp(const char *name) : HepTagDbApplication(name)
  {};
  
  int run()
  {
    // print an 
    message("about to initialise the db connection");
    Init();        // initialise the db session
    message("starting an update transaction");
    startUpdate(); // start an update transaction

    // create a new database (file)
    HepDatabaseRef  myDb = db("MyDatabase");

    // if the database ref is not valid:
    // - print a message
    // - exit the application with an error code 
    if (myDb == 0)
      fatal("could not find or create MyDatabase");
    
    // create a new container in this database
    HepContainerRef cont = container("MyContainer"); 
    if (cont == 0 )
      fatal("could not find or create MyDatabase");

    // work with the container and database
    // (e.g. create histograms, tags or other persistent objects)
      
    for (short i=0; i&lt;1000; i++)
    {
      // create a new event in my container
      HepRef(HepEvent) event = new(cont) HepEvent;
      if (event == 0) 
        fatal("could not create a new event");
    }
    message("created 1000 events");

    printContainerMap( ) ;

    // delete the container from the database
    // including all events
    HepDelete(cont);
    warning("deleted the container");

    // delete the database from the federation
    HepDelete(myDb);
    warning("deleted the database");

    // commit all changes made during this transaction
    commit();
    return 0;
  }
  
};

int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
{
  dbAccessApp myApp(argv[0]);  // create an application object
  return myApp.run();    // call it's run method
}
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


















<P>
The <TT>HepDbApplication</TT> class defines the transaction methods 
<TT>abort</TT>, <TT>commit</TT>, <TT>startRead</TT>, 
<TT>startUpdate</TT> (described already in Section
<a href="H1AccessOBJDatabase.html#H2AccesssOBJ">[H2AccesssOBJ]</a>),
as well as four methods for sending an informative string to the
user console: <TT>fatal</TT> (prints a fatal error message and
aborts), <TT>error</TT> and <TT>warning</TT>,  (prints an 
error and warning message and continue), and
<TT>message</TT> (just prints a message).



















</P>
<P>
The <TT>HepDatabaseRef</TT> declaration sets up a database handle
<TT>myDb</TT> using the <TT>db</TT> method from the <TT>ooSession</TT>
class. Once we have opened a database, we declare a container with
<TT>HepContainerRef</TT>, which returns us a handle <TT>cont</TT>
using the <TT>container</TT> method from the <TT>ooSession</TT>
class. The container handle is then used to store one thousand events
of type <TT>HepEvent</TT> inside the <TT>for</TT> loop. Just before we
delete our database we print a map of the containers with the
<TT>printContainerMap</TT> method, which shows the containers together
with their object identifiers (the <TT>HepSystem</TT> and
<TT>ExplorableDescr</TT> containers are created when HEPODBMS is set
up in the <TT>System</TT> database).  Finally, we delete the container
and database by specifying their respective handles to the
<TT>HepDelete</TT> method. Below, the output generated by the above
C++ code is shown.
