<A NAME="H1HistogramTagClasses">5. Histogram and tag classes</A>
</H1>

<P>
All classes are being documented and a user guide and
reference manual for the available components will be available soon.
In this chapter we shall describe the main characteristics of the
HTL classes and also learn about the tag classes. 
As explained before, ready-to-run examples can be found in the 
following two directories.
</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
$LHCXXTOP/share/HepODBMS/pro/HepODBMS/examples
$LHCXXTOP/share/HTL/pro/HTL/examples/
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
As already explained in the preface at the beginning of the 
document, each
example has its own subdirectory (corresponding to the first part
of the filename, i.e., preceding the suffix <TT>.cpp</TT>, specified
as a comment on the first line of the examples' C++ code in this
manual), which contains the C++ source code in a file with extension
<TT>cpp</TT>, as well as a <TT>GNUmakefile</TT> which will compile,
link and generate an executable if run with <TT>gmake</TT>. These
example programs should form an excellent basis to get started writing
your own application programs.


</P>


<H2>
<A NAME="PERSISTENTHISTOS">5.1. The HTL package</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Persistent HTL Package provides the basic histogramming
functionality of HBOOK along with some additional features.
See the <A HREF="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/HTL/index.html">here</A>
for more details.

</P>



<H2>5.2. Converting an HBOOK file into an Objectivity/DB database</H2>


<P>The program <TT>Hbook2Objy</TT>

converts histograms contained in an HBOOK file into persistent HTL
histograms that can be saved in an Objectivity/DB database. Only one- and
two-dimensional histograms are converted, Ntuples are ignored. To
execute the program you should type:</P>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
Hbook2Objy &lt;hfile&gt; &lt;OBJ-federated-DB&gt;
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Starting from the histograms in the HBOOK file <TT>&lt;hfile&gt;</TT>
the program will create a new database with as name the name of the
HBOOK file <TT>&lt;hfile&gt;</TT> inside the Objectivity/DB database pointed at by
the environment variable <TT>OO_FD_BOOT</TT>.  If <TT>&lt;hfile&gt;</TT>
already exists, then you will be asked whether you want to overwrite 
the original file.



</P>

<P>It should be noted that the hierarchical (directory) structure of
the HBOOK file is not preserved. Nevertheless, since the name of each
created persistent histogram corresponds to the full path name inside
the HBOOK hierarchy, it is easy to distinguish between histograms with
the same name but coming from different HBOOK directories.  An example
of the translation of a set of HBOOK histograms is shown 
in Figure <a href="H1HistogramTagClasses.html#PAW2HISTOO">[PAW2HISTOO]</a>.

<H2>5.3. The tag classes</H2>



<H3>5.3.1. Explaining the environment</H3>

<P>The following <TT>gmake</TT> file supposes the Objectivity/DB database and
IRIS Explorer path and environment variables have been set up for
the current session.</P>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
# GNUmakefile for createTag example
# Dirk Duellmann

HEP_ODBMS_DIR=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/specific/@sys/HepODBMS/development
include $(HEP_ODBMS_DIR)/etc/HepODBMS.mk

APPL       = createTag
SRCS       = $(APPL).cpp 
OBJS	   = $(OS)/$(APPL).o

all : $(APPL)

	$(C++) $(C_FLAGS) -o $(APPL) $(OBJS) $(HEP_ODBMS_LIBS) $(OBJY_LIBS) $(RWTOOL_LIBS)

</TABLE>



<H3>5.3.2. Writing tags</H3>

<P>As explained earlier (see Section <a href="H1LHCPPObjectModel.html#SNEWDATAMODEL">[SNEWDATAMODEL]</a>),
tags are a small collection of the most important physics attributes
of an event plus an association with the event in question.  Tags
provide a natural and efficient syntax for handling event data,
speeding up queries, cuts handling, etc., substantially, while at the
same time offering the possibility to easily access the original full
data. Usually, the event tags are chosen in such a way that a high
degree of selectivity can be obtained by first cutting on attributes
in the event tag, while, if needed, the association to the full event
can be exploited in order to retrieve any other information not
contained in the tag.</P>



<P>In workgroup-wide data sets, individual physicists should still be
able to have their own simpler data collection, so an easy-to-use
<EM>Generic Tag</EM> is defined as well.  Presently, both the Event Tag 
and the Generic Tag have to be created inside a C++ program before using
the Interactive Analysis framework.</P>


<P>
The data types that can be stored in a tag are <TT>long</TT> and
<TT>short</TT> integers, <TT>float</TT> and <TT>double</TT> real
numbers, and an 8-bit <TT>char</TT>. These types are recognised by the
<EM>HepExplorableBrowser</EM> module
(see Figure <a href="H1HEPExplorerModules.html#HEPEXPBROWSER">[HEPEXPBROWSER]</a>)
which lets you browse and select explorable collections and their tags.



</P>

<P>
Examples of the use of tags are given in the HEPODBMS manual (see the
URL <A HREF="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/HepODBMS/user-guide/H1CollectionsTags.html">here</A>
for more details).
</P>




<H3>5.3.3. Converting HBOOK Ntuples to Objectivity/DB</H3>

<P>
The LHC++ environment provides tools to convert existing HBOOK Ntuples
to Objectivity/DB. 
At the URL <A HREF="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/HepExplorer/ntkit/ntupleconv.html">here</A>
you can find more details.
