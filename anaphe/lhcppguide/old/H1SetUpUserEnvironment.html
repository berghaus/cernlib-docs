<A NAME="H1SetUpUserEnvironment">3. Setting up the user environment</A>
</H1>

<P>
At the beginning of 1999 a central database service will be run for
the various experiments using Objectivity/DB. However, as we want users to be
able to test the LHC++ environment <EM>today</EM> the Unix
installation procedure will presently create a database in your AFS
space <EM>on a given machine</EM>. So, until your experiment will
have set up its central Objectivity/DB database server, you <EM>must</EM>
always connect to that same machine if you want to access your
database. This inconvenience is only temporary and, apart from having
to connect to the given node, everything else is completely
transparent and all your C++ code will work unchanged in the future
configuration.



</P>


<H2>3.1. Installing for the first time</H2>


<P>The HEPExplorer environment is essentially a combination of Objectivity/DB,
IRIS Explorer, and HEP-specific add-ons.  Therefore, you should first
check that the following preliminary conditions are met.</P>




<UL>
<LI>Your computing platform is supported. At present it must be
one of the following:
HP-UX 10.20, Solaris 2.5 and 2.6, AIX 4.2, DEC UNIX 4.0, and
Windows/NT.</LI>
<LI>You have an IRIS Explorer licence (only relevant outside CERN, 
    since CERN has a site licence).</LI>
<LI>You have a licence for Objectivity/DB (Objectivity/DB licenses are managed by the
    experiments; see below).


</LI>
<LI>At CERN, when on Unix, your host must be connected to AFS or for
    Windows/NT connected to Nice. Outside CERN, or on non-connected nodes at CERN,
    you must first get access to the distribution kit and then install it.



</LI>
</UL>

<P>At CERN, IRIS Explorer is available centrally and some Work Group
Servers.</P>

<P>Thus, a prerequisite for using HEPExplorer is that you have access
to an Objectivity/DB database to contain your histograms and the proper schema
for the histogram classes.  If you do not yet have such a database set
up, you should contact your experiment's or group's Objectivity/DB coordinator,
who will take the necessary steps to register you for database use.
You will then be assigned a <EM>Federated Database IDentifier</EM>
(FDID), to uniquely identify your federated database to the Objectivity/DB
servers. This number should be specified when first installing the
database environment, as described below.



</P>

<P>
Once you are registered for use of the database, and you know your
unique database identifier <TT>MY_FDID</TT>, you can install the
database and the other parts of HEPExplorer. This mainly involves
copying something from the AFS or Nice space to your account, and
setting some environment variables.
</P>

<P>
The initial installation procedure does not require user
intervention. Whenever there's a choice and no further information is
provided, a reasonable default that should be satisfactory for most
users will be selected.
</P>


<H3>3.1.1. Unix-specific procedures</H3>

<P>
To fully install the different components you need to use
HEPExplorer you should merely type two commands (the first defines 
your FDID, the second starts the intallation).
</P>

</TR>
</TABLE>



<P>
Let us have a look at what the installation script did (<EM>if you are
not interested in this, you can skip this paragraph; however, you
should still verify the last part of the output, as we shall explain
below.</EM>) The installation script starts by copying IRIS Explorer related
information, such as types, include files, man pages, DataFit 
and HEPExplorer files, into your IRIS Explorer directory (defined
with the <TT>EXPLORERUSERHOME</TT> environment variable).
Then it installs the Objectivity/DB database, in the <TT>explorer</TT> subdirectory
(<TT>/afs/cern.ch/user/g/goossens/HP-UX/explorer</TT> in our case).
The boot file is called <TT>HEPEXP</TT>, the federated database
itself <TT>HEPEXP.FDDB</TT> (see the directory listing below).</P>



<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>

</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
It is the environment variable <TT>OO_FD_BOOT</TT>, containing
the full path name of the boot file, which will be used by Objectivity/DB to
get access to the database in subsequent sessions. Note that we have
specified our unique federated database identifier which we got from
our database administrator by setting the <TT>MY_FDID</TT>
variable (the value used was <TT>30500</TT>, which should
<EM>NEVER</EM> be used by anybody else).  Now that the database is
set up, a small test program is copied to the
<TT>explorer</TT> directory, compiled and run.
</P>

<P>
It is <EM>important</EM> that everybody checks whether the output
generated at the end of the installation corresponds to the lines
shown above. Also, the startup script (<TT>hepexp.ksh</TT>
above) will be prepared. This small script defines a set of
environment variables for IRIS Explorer, the
<TT>OO_FD_BOOT</TT> variable, identifying the Objectivity/DB boot file,
and checks whether you are logged in to the same node as where the
database was created (<TT>hpplus16</TT> in the example).
</P>

<P>
You <EM>must</EM> execute this small shell script 
every time you login on the system as described below.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
<EM>csh flavour</EM>: the file is named
<TT>~/$OS/hepexp.csh</TT> and you should add to your
<TT>.login </TT>script the following line:

<P>
<TT>source ~/$OS/hepexp.csh</TT>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P> <EM>ksh flavour</EM>: the file is named

<P>
<TT>. ~/$OS/hepexp.ksh</TT>
</P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<EM>If you forget to update your startup script
(<TT>.login</TT> or <TT>.profile</TT>) you will not be
able to use any HEPExplorer component on your next login. On top of
that, to have the environment variables initialized correctly, you
must logout and then login again.</EM>
</P>





<H3>3.1.2. Windows/NT-specific procedures</H3>

<P>In order to keep as many similarities as possible between the NT
and Unix versions, we also chose to use Unix tools on Windows/NT (e.g.,
<TT>gmake</TT>), rather than go for a <EM>native</EM>
version. This policy could change in the future, according to general
guidelines for multiplatform support agreed with the experiments.
</P>


<H4>3.1.2. Unix utilities on NT</H4>

<P>
The present general policy of IT division is to use the utilities
provided by Cygnus (see <A HREF="http://www.cygnus.com">here</A>).  They
are installed on Nice and provide the most common GNU/Unix
tools, such as, <TT>gmake</TT>, <TT>bash</TT>,
<TT>tar</TT>, etc.  Users have the choice to work with GNU's
<TT>bash</TT> shell, or Windows/NT's native <TT>cmd</TT>
shell.
</P>



<H4>3.1.2. Locating the LHC++ components on Nice</H4>

<P>
The directory structure of the LHC++ installation tree on Nice
mimics the structure of Unix on AFS as closely as possible.
</P>

<P>
In particular, when procedures and examples for Unix in this guide
refer to the path <TT>/afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx</TT>, then on
Nice the equivalent path is <TT>Z:\P32\lhcxx</TT>. This applies
to libraries, include files, etc. Moreover, uses of the environment
variable <TT>LHCXXTOP</TT>, which refer to the above path, on
Windows/NT map to <TT>%LHCXXTOP%</TT> with the <TT>cmd</TT>
shell, and remain unchanged <TT>$LHCXXTOP</TT> with the
<TT>bash</TT> shell.
</P>




<H4>3.1.2. Running the installation scripts</H4>

<P>
Although the environment is installed on Nice disk servers, we do
not use Nice menus and scripts to access LHC++ components at
present. We follow a Unix-like approach where the LHC++ applications
are executed inside an environment that is setup by a script.  This
allows quick and easy customization of the users' environment without
touching the general PC configuration.
</P>

<P>
Details on how to install LHC++ on your Windows/NT system are
available in the following file on Nice.
</P>

</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>






<H2>3.2. Full re-installation procedure on Unix</H2>

<P>
If you already had an Objectivity/DB database before, and want to reinstall
everything, you must clean up your environment first. Thus, if you
have any environment settings related to Objectivity/DB or IRIS Explorer you
should remove them (you can still customise your environment later).
Please check that your <TT>PATH</TT> environment variable and
the shared library path environment variable
(<TT>SHLIB_PATH</TT> or <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT> or
<TT>LIBPATH</TT>, depending on your Unix flavour) contain
just the minimum needed for your current needs.

</P>




<H2>3.3. Customising the installation procedure on Unix</H2>

<P>
The installation procedure can be customised to provide different
locations for your IRIS Explorer home directory and for the Federated
Database.




</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
To define a different IRIS Explorer home directory set the 
<TT>EXPLORERUSERHOME</TT> environment variable, e.g.,
</P>
<P>csh flavour</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
  setenv EXPLORERUSERHOME ~/explorer
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>ksh flavour</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
  export EXPLORERUSERHOME=~/explorer
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>
To define a different location for your <EM>starter</EM> Federated
Database set the <TT>OO_FD_BOOT</TT> environment variable,
e.g.,</P>  



<P>csh flavour</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
  setenv OO_FD_BOOT ~/myfd/MYFDNAME
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>ksh flavour</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
  export OO_FD_BOOT=~/myfd/MYFDNAME
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
By defining more environment variables the installation procedure
can be instructed to skip part of the installation.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<P>To skip the HEPExplorer setup (user types and fitting add-ons) set
the <TT>NO_INSTALL_HEPEXP</TT> environment variable, e.g.,</P>
<P>csh flavour</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
  setenv NO_INSTALL_HEPEXP 1
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>ksh flavour</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
  export NO_INSTALL_HEPEXP=1
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</LI>
<LI>To skip the installation of the <EM>starter</EM> Federated
Database set the <TT>NO_INSTALL_HISTODB</TT> environment variable,
e.g.,




<P>csh flavour</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
  setenv NO_INSTALL_HISTODB 1
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>ksh flavour</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
  export NO_INSTALL_HISTODB=1
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</LI>
</UL>



<H2>3.4. Check list on Unix</H2>


<P>Right after logging in you should check that there are no warning
messages generated by the HEPExplorer startup script. In particular,
check whether you have no message of the type:</P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
HEPExplorer message: you logged in on the wrong node
Please logout and login again on hpplus16
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>In this case, the original database was created on the node
<TT>hpplus16</TT>, so that only from that node you can read and
modify the database.</P>

<P>Similarly, using the <TT>env</TT> command, check that the following
environment variables are set (correctly):</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<TT>OO_FD_BOOT</TT>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>EXPLORERHOME</TT>
</LI>
<LI>
<TT>EXPLORERUSERHOME</TT>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>If one of them is not set, then it is very likely that you forgot
to update your startup script (check your <TT>.login</TT> or 
<TT>.profile</TT> file).</P>




<H3>3.4.1. Installation troubleshooting</H3>



<P>
Installation procedure failure is usually due to one of the following
reasons.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<EM>Missing access rights to the Objectivity package.</EM>
In this case the installation exits with an error message and you should
get your Objectivity licence before trying again.
</LI>
<LI>
<EM>Lockserver running in autorecovery mode.</EM>
Use the Unix <TT>ps</TT> command to find out the lockserver's running mode:
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
ps -ef | grep ools
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
If you see something like:
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
dinofm 20536 1 0 Oct 27 ? 1:37 ools
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
restart the lockserver in the proper mode:
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
&gt; ookillls
&gt; oolockserver -noautorecovery
&gt; ps -ef | grep ools
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
where the <TT>ps</TT> command should show something like:
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD CLASS="PRE">
<PRE>
dinofm 20536 1 0 Oct 27 ? 1:37 ools -OO_NO_AUTOREC
</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</LI>
<LI>
<EM>Polluted environment.</EM>
If your installation fails and you retry 
a reinstall immediately, there might still be some
environment variables set from your previous try. Therefore,
if your installation fails, it is advisable to logout and login again 
to try and install the system once more.
