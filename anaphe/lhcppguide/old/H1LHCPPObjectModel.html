<H2>2.1. A historical digression: Ntuples and PAW</H2>

<P>
During the past decade, many HEP experiments  have based their
interactive data analysis on the following steps
(see the top half of Figure <a href="H1LHCPPObjectModel.html#NTUPLETAGDB">[NTUPLETAGDB]</a>).
</P>

<OL>
<LI>
<EM>Raw and reconstructed</EM> data are stored in <EM>banks</EM> in an
experiment-specific hierarchical format.  Most of the time one uses
many different files on several distinct hosts.
</LI>
<LI>
These data are <EM>distilled</EM> and <EM>reclustered</EM> to obtain a
more compact and thus more efficient representation. This permits a
significant speed-up for the down-stream analysis compared to using
the data in their raw form as described in point 1.  This format
corresponds to the so-called HBOOK Ntuples.  One drawback of this
method is that the direct relation to the raw <EM>event data</EM> is
lost.


</LI>
<LI>
Ntuple files are analysed <EM>interactively</EM> with programs
like PAW. Plots of physics variables are produced by extracting
information contained in one or more of the Ntuple rows or columns,
binning them in HBOOK histograms and then operating on these histograms
to obtain the best representation. 

</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The advantage of Ntuples is that their format is known and simple enough, 
so that a general purpose analysis tool, such as PAW can cope with data
coming from any experiment. On the other hand, since no link to the
original data exists, Ntuples impose a limitation on the structure of
the data physicists can use for their analysis. On top of that, since
the data were copied from the original files into a dedicated Ntuple
file, each time original dataset changed most Ntuple files had to be
regenerated.


</P>
<P>
Two kinds of Ntuples exists. <EM>Row-Wise Ntuples</EM> transform a
complex data structure into a simple tabular form.  <EM>Column-Wise
Ntuples</EM> on the other hand improve the flexibility of the Ntuple data
model by allowing the definition of variable-length items, but they
still are difficult to use to describe complex data structures, like
those of the reconstructed data.  Moreover, the Ntuple Query language
is rather non-intuitive and complex to master.
</P>



<H2>
<A NAME="SNEWDATAMODEL">2.2. The new Data Model</A>
</H2>

<P>
Most new HEP experiments assume that it will be possible to make both
raw data and reconstructed data available <EM>on-line</EM> thanks to
the integration between Objectivity/DB and HPSS. Each experiment will
have its own data model and physicists should be able to
<EM>navigate</EM> through it. This is a major problem for a
general-purpose Interactive Analysis environment, since, unlike the
Ntuple case, there no longer exists a common and pre-defined data
model shared amongst all experiments. This problem can be solved but there
is no easy way out: the general-purpose tool should be able to access
the arbitrary experiment data model using some kind of run time type
information or the initial data model definition.


</P>

<P>
Since all data is supposed to be <EM>on-line</EM>, the role of the Ntuple
replacement could be quite different. While reasonably small
<EM>personal</EM> data collections will still exist, the main concern
will probably be how to index large event stores to speed up the
analysis. 
</P>

<P>
The RD45 Project suggested one approach to deal with both problems.
The idea it to speed up queries by defining for each event a <EM>Tag</EM>, 
i.e., a small collection of its most important physics attributes plus
an association with the event where the Tag data come from. Such
<EM>Concrete</EM> Tags contain copies of data members of a 
persistent data class. A collection of tag objects 
is saved together in a Tag Database, something 
intermediate between an Event Directory and an Ntuple.
Since they are globally defined for the whole experiment, concrete
tags can be optimized so that they offer a very efficient way to make
initial cuts on attributes, thus achieving a high degree of
selectivity.  On top of that, at any moment you are able to cross the
association to the event if you want to retrieve any other details
about the full event, which are not contained in the Tag (see bottom
part of Figure <a href="H1LHCPPObjectModel.html#NTUPLETAGDB">[NTUPLETAGDB]</a>).

<B>The Ntuple and TagDB models</B>
</P>










<P>
In general the selection of <EM>key</EM> attributes characterising 
events will be made by the experiment or group, so that concrete tags
are mostly defined for experiment-wide or
workgroup-wide data sets. However, individual physicists have
the possibility to define their own simpler data collection by using
the <EM>Generic Tag</EM> mechanism. This second light-weight procedure
allows you to define a tag <EM>on the fly</EM>, without creating a
persistent class. Compared to the concrete tag, there is, of course, a
small performance penalty, but this is most of the time balanced by
an increased flexibility, since at any time new fields can be added to
the tag and the association to the complete event data remains
available. Presently, both the concrete tag
and the generic tag are defined in a C++ program before being
used in the Interactive Analysis framework.






</P>



<H2>2.3. Implementing the Data Model: explorable collections</H2>

<P>
When creating a tag (either generic or concrete) a description of its
fields (name and type) must be provided. This information is used
later to access the data. The set of individual
tags is called an <EM>Explorable Collection</EM>,
i.e., a collection of objects implementing an IRIS Explorer access
interface.



</P>

<P>
Explorable collections are data that you can analyse using
The principle of operation in described in 
Figure <a href="H1LHCPPObjectModel.html#FIAM">[FIAM]</a>.

<P>
To plot an histogram, you start by picking your explorable collection
using the Browser, and then define your cuts and histogram variables
using the Selector, before filling your Histogram.  Apart from
accessing the data in the tag, you are able to invoke C++ methods that
implement, e.g., common physics or access the experiment specific
event object (by traversing the association between a tag and its
related event). User-defined functions can be used whenever a C++
expression is allowed.
All these possibilities are explained in much more detail

in Section <a href="H1HEPExplorerModules.html#HEPExplorerexplorable">[HEPExplorerexplorable]</a>.
