Regular (bi-weekly) Anaphe and RD45 meetings are held in Building
40. This is an ideal forum for communication with the physics
community since its allows us to bring our users regularly up to date
with the latest news. Also, and more importantly, it provides us with
an input channel from the experiments about how they use the software,
which are possible problem areas which have to be addressed, and what
are the future developments they would like to see.  The minutes as
well as material presented on the progress in the various areas are
<a href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/meetings/index.html" target="_top"> available
on the Web</a>.

Twice a year a formal <a href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/workshops.html" target="_top">Anaphe
Workshop</a> takes place where progress reports are presented by
all HEP-wide collaborations who are using Anaphe software. This
Workshop provides an efficient forum for feedback from the experiments
and permits us to steer long-term development in the right direction
by taking into account constraints and requirements of as wide a user
base as possible.
