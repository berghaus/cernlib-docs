In 1999 a central service will be run for the various experiments using Objectivity/DB
to provide access to their databases
from various platforms using AMS. However, at present, it is necessary to
associate a federated database with a given machine, so that you must
always connect to that same machine if you want to access that
database.





</p><p>
In particular, when working on a cluster (such as hpplus) you must
remember the real node name (e.g., <tt>hpplus16</tt>, as in
the example in the previous chapter) of the machine which you used to
create the database.  When you want to use the database in a later
session, you must always connect to that node, otherwise you will not
be able to access your data (unless your experiment is running Objectivity/DB's
AMS, a facility to share databases across the network).
</p><p>
The first step (after creating the database) is to tell Objectivity/DB
where it can be found. This is done with the environment variable
<tt>OO_FD_BOOT</tt>, which should be set to the full path name
of the boot file of the database that you want to access.  This boot
file is actually a small ASCII file, which contains valuable
information about your federated database.

</pre><p>You should <i>NEVER</i> change its contents!</p><p>
In particular, changing the path of the federated database in this
file after you moved it will <i>not</i> work.



</p><p>
Once the <tt>OO_FD_BOOT</tt> variable is set correctly, you can
run the Objectivity/DB management tools. For instance the program
oodumpcatalog displays the catalog, showing
the different databases associated to the current federated database.

Thus, in the example above, we see that we need to connect to the node
<tt>hpplus16</tt> (the so-called <i>Lock
Host</i>).  It should also be noted that each federated
database should have a different federated database number to enforce
proper locking management when the same lockserver is used by more
than one federation (e.g., when the lockserver is running on a central
service, such as hpplus).  A series of federated database numbers have
been allocated to experiments and user groups (see <a href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/cernlib/rd45/recommendations/dba.html">
<i>Draft recommendations concerning Objectivity/DB DBA
issues</i></a> for a proposed list). As explained above, when
registering as a database user with your experiment's or group's
Objectivity/DB's coordinator, you get a unique number assigned to ensure the
uniqueness of the federated database number.
