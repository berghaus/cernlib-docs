\section*{Preliminary remarks}
 
This manual serves at the same time as an introduction 
to the various components of LHC++ and also aims to help
you to get started with the system.

Chapter 1 briefly describes the objectives of the LHC++ Project and
describes its various components, while the LHC++ Analysis Model is
introduced in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 explains what you should do to set
up the LHC++ environment, and Chapter 4 gives a few hints about the
object database. The histogram and tag classes and their use are the
subject of Chapter 5, while Chapter 6 shows how you can visualize
these objects with IRIS Explorer using the HEPExplorer modules.
Chapter 7 contains a few examples of publicly available non HEP-specific
IRIS Explorer modules. Finally, a list of HEPExplorer modules and
maps, a glossary, and an index conclude this guide.

\section*{If you need help}

The LHC++ Project page is available on WWW at the URL:
\begin{center}
\fbox{\texttt{http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/lhc++/index.html}}
\end{center}
In particular, you have an entry to submit error reports using the
GNATS-based problem tracking system (see also Section~\ref{S-GNATS}).
The page also tells you how to subscribe to the LHC++ mailing list,
and presents a detailed list of LHC++ contact persons.  \index{GNATS}

\section*{Documentation and examples}
\label{SEC:DOCEXA}
\index{Examples!location}\index{Examples!running \~{}}%
\index{Documentation!location}%

Examples for the HTL and hepodbms packages
are available in the directories:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|ll|}\hline
Unix & \texttt{/afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/share/HTL/pro/HTL/examples}\\
     & \texttt{/afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/share/HepODBMS/pro/HepODBMS/examples}\\[1mm]

     & \texttt{Z:\bs P32\bs lhcxx\bs share\bs HepODBMS\bs pro\bs HepODBMS\bs examples}\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Each example has its own subdirectory, containing the C++ source code
in a file with extension \texttt{cpp}, as well as a
\texttt{GNUmakefile} which allows you to generate an executable with
\texttt{gmake}.

The \textsc{html} version of this guide can be found at the URL
\url{http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asdoc/lhcpp/lhcpp.html}. The printable
PostScript version is also available from that page.  Alternatively,
the same PostScript file can be obtained as a gzipped compressed file
\texttt{lhcpp.ps.gz}, from any CERN machine, or any machine registered
for cernlib access, by anonymous ftp as follows (commands to be typed
by the user are underlined):
