coherent set of inter-operable solutions. They are built on standards
and often come as part of the standard hardware or software bundled
with the computer. Cost effectiveness has also been optimised both
for CERN and for the general CERN HEP program participants.

<a href="http://www.sgi.com/Products/Dev_environ_ds.html">
<i>OpenGL</i></a> is an industry standard for
graphics. It is vendor-neutral and multi-platform, and is optimised
for building environments for developing 2D and 3D visual
applications. Several vendors already offer a hardware implementation
of the standard, thus ensuring that rendering speed will be optimal.
</p><p>
The about 250 OpenGL procedures provide a wide range of graphics
features, such as a set of geometric and raster primitives, various
colour modes, display list or immediate mode, viewing and modelling
transformations, lighting and shading, hidden surface removal and
translucency, anti-aliasing, texture mapping, effects using fog,
smoke, or haze, etc.  As all licensed OpenGL implementations are
required to pass a set of conformance tests, and implement the same
specification and language binding document full portability between
multiple platforms is guaranteed.
</p><p>
Documentation is available as two books: the <i>OpenGL
Programming Guide</i>, and the <i>OpenGL Reference
Manual</i>, both published by Addison and Wesley (available
from the <i>Computing Bookshop</i> in IT
Division).

<a href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/Inventor/index.html"><i>Open
Inventor</i></a> is an object-oriented 3D toolkit to
provide a comprehensive solution to interactive graphics programming.
Its programming model is based on a 3D scene database optimised to
ease building graphics applications. It includes a large set of
objects, such as cubes, polygons, text, materials, cameras, lights,
track-balls, handle boxes, 3D viewers, and editors.
</p><p>
Open Inventor is built on top of OpenGL. It defines a standard file
format (IV) for 3D data interchange and introduces a simple event
model for 3D interaction. Animation is provided with
<i>Engines</i>. Open Inventor offers a convenient
multi-platform 3D graphics development environment, which allows
efficient manipulation of objects in a windows and operating system
independent way.
</p><p>
Open Inventor's IV files serve as the basis for the 
<a href="http://vrml.wired.com">
<i>VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language)</i>
standard</a>. The Open Inventor toolkit is conveniently documented
in three books <i>The Inventor Mentor</i>, <i>The
Inventor Toolmaker</i>, and <i>The Open Inventor C++
Reference Manual</i> published by Addison-Wesley (available
from the CERN Computing Bookshop).
</p></div><div id="N3033" class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><h3 class="title"><a name="N3033"></a>Objectivity/DB, the Object Database</h3></div><p>
In order to study solutions for storing and handling the multi-Pbyte
data samples expected with LHC, the <a href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/cernlib/rd45/index.html"><i>RD45
Project</i></a> was established in 1995.  The proposed
solution should also be able to cope with other persistent objects,
such as histograms, calibration monitoring data, etc. It was found
that the best candidate for handling this problem is a <a href="http://www.odmg.org/"><i>ODMG</i> (Object Database
Management Group)</a>, compliant object database used together
with a mass storage system, based upon the IEEE reference model for
mass storage systems. After considering a few alternatives, the
presently favoured solution uses <a href="http://www.objy.com/"><i>Objectivity/DB</i></a> and
<a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/hpss/"><i>HPSS</i> (High
Performance Storage System)</a>.




</p><p>
The Objectivity/DB database provides object-persistency services for GEANT-4
and the experimental data. It must fully support HEP meta-data, not
only the persistent data collections themselves, but it must also
handle the selections producing these collections, and the predicates
themselves. Replication of large database images on local area and
wide area network configurations containing heterogeneous hardware
must allow collaborators all over the world to actively participate in
data analysis. Given the large time scales (the lifetime of the LHC
software will span at least twenty years) schema evolution and
versioning are important aspects which must be taken into account.
Objectivity/DB comes with a set of administrative tools to ease database
management. Objectivity/DB also comes with an <i>Advanced Multi-threaded
Server</i> (AMS) and an interface to HPSS.
This provides fast access to data and offers a large performance
improvement when updating data stored in remote databases. It is
expected that each experiment will run starting in 1998 a production
service of one or more of these servers.





</p><p>
Objectivity/DB has a layered logical storage level, with at its top the
<i>federated database</i>. Each federated database logically
contains one or more <i>databases</i>, with the latter containing
the <i>objects</i>, which are clustered, for efficiency, inside
<i>containers</i>. An <i>object</i> itself consists of standard
C++ constructs, variable-size arrays, relationships and references to
other objects, and type constraints. Persistent objects can be created
and deleted dynamically by any application. The data model, or
<i>schema</i> is stored inside the federated database.

CERN no longer has any in-house mathematician supporting mathematics
libraries. Therefore, we shall have to rely on libraries developed
outside CERN, and it was decided to make the <a href="http://www.nag.co.uk/numeric/CL.html"><i>NAG
C-language</i></a> library available.  Although the NAG C
Library provides the basic functionality required by HEP, a small
number of routines (basically special functions) are currently
unavailable.  A future release of the above library is likely to
incorporate these routines.


</p></div><div id="N3193" class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><h3 class="title"><a name="N3193"></a>Statistical Data Analysis: the Gemini package</h3></div><p>
Gemini is a GEneral MINImization and error analysis package
implemented as a C++ class library. Minuit's functionality is provided
in a <i>Minuit-style</i> (even if, internally, another
minimizer may actually do the work) and new functionality offered by
NAG C minimizers is added. Gemini thus provides a unified C++ API both
to standard Minuit and to NAG C family of minimizers. For the common
subset of functionality, it is up to the user which minimization
engine does the work: Minuit or NAG C. The user can easily switch
between various minimizers without essential changes in the
application code. The currently supported set of minimizers (Minuit
and NAG C) can be extended without essential changes in the API.
</p><p>
The abstract base class <tt>GEmini</tt> defines an
interface to the common functionality. The
<tt>CMinuit</tt> class is derived from
<tt>GEmini</tt> and provides a Minuit-based
implementation of the GEmini functionality plus Minuit-specific
extensions. Similarly, the <tt>NAGmin</tt> class is
derived from <tt>GEmini</tt> as well and provides a
NAG-based implementation of the <tt>GEmini</tt>
functionality plus NAG-specific extensions.


</p><p>
There is no single class which contains references both to Minuit and
to NAG C, so that orthodox Minuit or Nag C users are not forced to
link the other library.
</p><p>
Gemini finds a minimum of an objective function, possibly subject to
general constraints, and performs an error analysis. The concept of
errors is that of Minuit, so that it is the user's responsibility to
properly scale the inversed Hessian, and to properly interpret the
results. Both Hessian based errors and Minos errors are
implemented. Correspondingly, two types of function contours (or
confidence regions, in statistical problems) are available: elliptical
and Minos ones. Minos error analysis is, however, possible only for
bound constraint problems.
