  <formalpara><title>No operator overloading</title>
      <para> For non-primitive types, operator can't be overloaded.
	For example, vectors can't be added as <literal>A +
	  B</literal>, but only as  <literal>A.plus(B)</literal>.
	There are attractions in allowing operator overloading to
	support mathematical operations where the notation is close to
	the normal mathematical formalism and one can take advantage of
	the operator precedence rules.
      </para>
    </formalpara>

    <formalpara><title>No automatic type narrowing.</title><para> The
	type conversion which could lead to a loss of precision
	doesn't happen automatically, but variables must be cast
	explicitly. This protects the developer from certain
	hard-to-find bugs and makes the behaviour of the code
	explicit, but some may find it annoying.</para>
