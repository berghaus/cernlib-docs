<P>
HTL has benefited from the suggestions, advice and help of many
individuals.  In particular the major part of HTL was written during
1998 by Savrak Sar, who worked for sixteen months at CERN as a French
<em>coop&eacute;rant</em>.
</P>

<P>
A special mention should be given to Yemi Adesanya and Jacub Moscicki
for the existing HistOOgrams package and the templated prototype; Dirk
D&uuml;llman and Marcin Nowak for help with Objectivity; Vincenzo
Innocente for his version of templated histograms; Olivier Couet and
Michel Goossens for general support.
