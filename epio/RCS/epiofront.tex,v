\Filename{H2EPIO-History}
\section*{History}

Hans Grote/SL was one of the original two authors of the EPIO package. 

The EPIO offline package is intended to be used for all data (at
least on tape) in an experiment, in such a way that from the raw data
tape to the DST, the tape (or file) format is identical. This makes the
transport of data between computers trivial, and simplifies the task of
passing the files or tapes at different stages of the production chain
through any other part of the production chain.
 
The package has been developed at CERN as a part of \Lit{packlib}.
\index{packlib@@\Lit{packlib}}
 
Version 1.66 of EPIO introduced a standard Fortran 77 version which is
the base for the Unix versions.

We would like to encourage all users to contact us in case:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item  they detect mistakes in the manual or the package,
\item  they would like to see something to be added to the
       manual or described in more detail,
\item  they would like to see features added to the package.
\end{itemize}
 
Remember that your collaboration in this is vital, and that the poor
man in (Saclay, Rome, Vienna, Hamburg, etc.) may desperately be trying to
find and fix a bug that you have just corrected, but told nobody (and
vice versa, of course).

\Filename{H2Preliminary-remarks}
\section*{Preliminary remarks}
 
This manual serves at the same time as a {\bf Reference manual}
and as a {\bf User Guide} for the EPIO package.
 
In this manual
examples are in {\tt monotype face} and strings to be input by the user 
are {\tt\underline{underlined}}.
In the index the page where a routine is defined is in {\bf bold},
page numbers where a routine is referenced are in normal type.

In the description of the routines a \Lit{*} following
the name of a parameter indicates that this is an {\bf output} parameter.
If another \Lit{*} precedes a parameter in the calling sequence, the
parameter in question is both an {\bf input} and {\bf output} parameter.

This document has been produced using \LaTeX~\cite{bib-LATEX}
with the \Lit{cernman} style option, developed at CERN. 
A compressed PostScript file \Lit{epio.ps.Z}, 
containing a complete printable version
of this manual, can be obtained from any CERN machine
by anonymous ftp as follows
(commands to be typed by the user are underlined):
