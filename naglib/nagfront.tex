Users of the NAG Library are reminded that its use is subject to a
licence agreement. In particular, no copies of any of its subroutines
may be taken to other installations without special permission. This
includes the export of any executable program containing NAG
subroutine(s). Access to the source code is limited, and if any user
makes any alteration to a NAG subroutine (which needs permission) the
user is
obliged to change the name, but copyright of the modified subroutine
belongs to NAG. Should any user be interested in performing such
modifications, the procedure is to inquire the CERN Program Library
Office about the possibility of accessing the source codes, defining the
user's objectives and purposes.
 
 
Requests for information should be addressed to:

\section*{Preliminary remarks}
 
This manual, providing the necessary information on the usage of
Numerical Algorithms Group Libraries at CERN, consists of:
 
\begin{ULc}
\item A description of the CERN implementation of various NAG products
is listed in Appendix A.
\item A user guide for the Fortran Library, describing how to access
the library and run examples on the different systems.
\item A user guide for the Graphics Library, describing how to access
the library and run examples on the different systems.
\item A tutorial example of usage of the Graphics Library. (The routines
included in the Graphics Library are listed in Appendix C)
\item A reprint of parts of the NAG Fortran Library Introductory Guide.
\item Reproduction of eps files obtained when running examples of NAG
Graphics usage.
\end{ULc}    
 
The latest versions of the libraries are installed on VXCERN, CERNVM,
CERNAPO and CSF services. Other installations are made upon request.
