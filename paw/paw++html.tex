\chapter{\PAWPP: A guided tour}

\PAWPP{} is a new and powerful OSF/\MOTIF{} based Graphical User Interface to
the popular Physics Analysis Workstation \XPAW.  The graphical user interface
makes the full and rich command set of \XPAW{} available to even the naive
user. Simple point and click operations are enough to execute commands that
were previously accessable only to expert users.

At present it is released on Unix workstations and VAX/VMS.

\PAWPP{} has, in addition to the conventional command line and macro types of
interface, the following dialogue modes:

\begin{DL}{Histogram style panel}
\item[Pull Down menus] They are useful to understand the command structure of
      the \XPAW{} system.
\item[Command panels] They give a ``panel representation'' of the commands.
\item[Object Browser] This is in many ways similar to the well-known browsers
      in the PC/MAC utilities or the visual tools on some workstations.
\item[Direct graphics] One can click in the graphics area and identify
      automatically which object has been selected. A pop-up menu appears
      with a list of possible actions on this object. For example, by clicking
      with the right mouse button on a histogram, one can make directly a
      gaussian fit, a smoothing etc.
      Pop-up menus are available by clicking on the \GW{} to
      automatically produce PostScript, Encapsulated PostScript, \LaTeX{} files
      or print the picture on your local printer.
\item[\HSP] Buttons are available to change
      histogram attributes, colours, line styles, fonts, and
      axes representation.
      2-D histograms can be rotated interactively. Zooming and rebinning can
      be performed interactivaly in real time.
\item[\NV] Just click on the Ntuple column name to histogram
      the column.
\end{DL}

The new system is largely self-explanatory. Only a subset of \XPAW{} has been
converted to this new user interface, but work is currently in progress to
offer many new facilities in future releases.

On all system on which the \CERNLIB{} is installed, it is enough to
type \Lit{paw++} to enter the system.

\PAWPP{} starts up with three windows on the screen:

\begin{DL}{The ``\PAWPP{} \EW''}
\item[The ``\PAWPP{} \EW'']
   Which is compose with a menu bar, a \TP, a current working
   directory indicator and an \IP.

\item[The ``\PAWPP{} Graphics 1'']
   window displays the graphics output from \HIGZ/\Xxi.
   Objects, e.g. histograms, displayed in the \GW{} can be
   manipulated by pointing at them, pressing the right mouse button and
   selecting an operation from the popup menu. Pointing at the edge of the
   \GW{} (between displayed object and window border) brings up a
   general popup menu. Up to 4 additional \GW{} can be opened by
   selecting ``Open New Window'' from this menu.

\item[The ``\PAWPP{} \MB'']
   displays all browsable classes and connected
   hbook files. Up to 4 additional browsers can be opened via the ``View'' menu
   of the ``\PAWPP{} \EW'' or via the ``Clone'' button on the
   browsers. For more information on the browsers see the ``Help'' menus.
\end{DL}

\section{Overview}

\PAWF{overview1}

\begin{UL}
\item The upper left corner is the \PAWPP{} \EW, with its \IP{}
      at the bottom and the \TP{} at the top.
\item The \PAWPP{} Browser, where the various entities (pictures, 1-D and
      2-D histograms and Ntuples) are all defined with their own symbol,
      is shown bottom left.  A ``pop-up'' menu has been activated for the 
      chosen 1-D histogram. Several actions like \Lit{Plot}, \Lit{Smooth},
      \Lit{Fit} etc... can be performed via this menu.
\item The \GW{} is seen top right. 
      A 1-D view of the data points and two 2-D views (a Surface-plot and a 
      colored contour plot) are shown.
      On the 1-D view, two 1-D histograms are 
      superimposed. The results of a ``smoothing'' type of fit to the data 
      points is also drawn. Information about the data and the fit can be found
      in the inserted window.
\item The \HSP{} at the lower right allows graphics
      attributes of the histogram to be controlled.
\end{UL}

\PAWF{overview2}

\begin{UL}
\item The upper left corner shows the \NV.
      The left window shows the name of the various variables, characterizing
      the selected Ntuple. Other windows and press-buttons specify which
      combinations of the various variables and which events
      have to be treated (plotted, scanned, \ldots).
\item The lower left contains the \PAWPP{} Browser, with this time an Ntuple
      selected. A double on a Ntuple icon
      open automatically the \NV{} on the active Ntuple.
\item The \GW{} is seen top right and shows a 3-D view
      of the combination of three variables, whose cuts are
      specified with the \CE{} (see below).
\item Direct graphics interactions with Ntuple data are possible. Just
      by clicking on a point in the  \GW, the event description is displayed
      in the \PL{} window.
\item The \CE{} panel, shown at the lower right, allows
      various combinations of cuts to be specified and applied.
\end{UL}

\section{The \EW}

\PAWF{executive}

This window allows to type commands on the keyboard like in the normal \XPAW{}
system. In fact this window is the \Lit{kxterm} program provide with the \KUIP{}
package.

This terminal emulator combines the best features from the (now defunct) Apollo
DM pads (like: \IP{} and \TP, automatic file backup of \TP, string search in 
pads, etc.) and the Korn shell emacs-style command line editing and command line
recall mechanism.

Commands are typed in the \IP{} \NbDB{1} behind the application prompt. Via the
toggle buttons \Button{H} \NbDB{4} the \IP{} and/or \TP{} can be placed in hold
mode. In hold mode one can paste or type a number of commands into the \IP{} and
edit them without sending the commands to the application. Releasing the hold 
button will causes \Lit{kxterm} to submit all lines, upto the line containing 
the cursor, to the application. To submit the lines below the cursor, just move
the cursor down. In this way one can still edit the lines just before they are
being submitted to the application.


\begin{EnumZB}
\item In the \IP{} one can type, retrieve and edit command line with the help of
      a Korn shell emacs-style command line editing mode. See in appendix the 
      complete list of the editing keys.
\item The \TP{} \NbDB{2} shows the executed commands and command output.
      When in hold mode \NbDB{4} the transcript pad does not scroll to make 
      the new text
      visible. Mouse operations like ``Copy Paste'' are allowed in the 
      transcript pad. It is also possible to search a character string (see the
      menu bar description).
\item Every time the current directory is changed, the {\bf Current working 
      directory indicator} is updated. The current working directory can be 
      changed by clicking on a item in the {\bf PATH window} of the \MB{} or
      by clicking on a icon directory in the \MB{} itself.
\item Hold buttons.
\end{EnumZB}
\begin{EnumZW}
\item Allows manipulation of the \TP. 
\item Allows character string seach, copy/paste in the \TP.
\item Allows to invoke other panel. 
\item Some general settings are available in this menu. 
\item Online help.
\end{EnumZW}

\section{The \MB}

The \KUIP/\MOTIF{} Browser interface is a general tool to display and
manipulate a tree structure of objects which are defined either by \KUIP{}
itself (commands, files, macros, etc.) or by the application.

The ``Clone'' button at the bottom creates a new independent browser window.
The ``Exit'' button destroys the browser window. The \MB{} cannot be
destroyed (only iconized).

The middle part of the browser is divided into two windows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The left hand ``class window'' shows the list of all currently connected
   classes of objects.  Some classes, e.g. the command tree and the file
   system, are predefined.  Other classes allow to attach new files using the
   commands in the ``File'' menu.  Clicking with the left mouse button on
   one of
   the items in the class window displays its content in the other window.
   Pressing the right mouse button inside the class window shows a popup menu
   of possible operations, e.g. creating a new object in the current
   directory.

\item The right hand ``object window'' shows the content of the currently
   selected class directory.  The ``View'' menu allows the change the way
   objects are displayed, i.e. to choose the icon size and the amount of
   information shown for each object.  Objects are selected by clicking on
   them with the left mouse button.  Pressing the right mouse button pops up a
   menu of possible operations depending on the object type.
\end{enumerate}

   An item in a popup menu is selected by pointing at the corresponding line
   and releasing the right mouse button.  Double clicking with the left mouse
   button is equivalent to selecting the first menu item.

   Each menu item executes a command sequence where the name of the selected
   object is filled into the appropriate place.  By default the command is
   executed immediately whenever possible. The commands executed can be seen
   by selecting ``Echo Commands'' in the ``Options'' menu of the \EW.
   In case some mandatory parameters are missing a panel is displayed
   where the remaining arguments have to be filled in.  The command is
   executed then by pressing the ``OK'' or ``Execute'' button in that panel.
   (If it is not the last one in the sequence of commands bound to the menu item
   the application is blocked until the ``OK'' or ``Cancel'' button is pressed.)

   The immediate command execution can be inhibited by holding down the
   CTRL-key BEFORE pressing the right mouse button.  Some popup menus also
   contain different menu item for immediate and delayed execution, e.g.
   ``Execute'' and ``Execute...'' for class ``Commands''

   The path of the currently selected directory is always displayed below the
   menu bar.  The directory can be changed by pointing at the tail of the
   wanted subpath and clicking the left mouse button.  Clicking a second time
   on the same path segment performs the directory change and updates the
   object window.  To go downwards in the directory hierarchy double click on
   the subdirectory displayed in the object window.

\PAWF{browser}

\begin{EnumZB}
\item Current PATH (``PATH window'').
\item Class window.
\item Name of file currently selected in the class window.
\item Name of the object currently selected in the object window.
\item Number and type of object currenlty in the the object window.
\item Object window.
\end{EnumZB}

\begin{EnumZW}
\item File menu.
\item View menu.
\item Options menu.
\item Commands menu.
\item Help menu.
\item Clone button.
\item Exit button.

      If you double click on one of the variable names
      a histogram showing the values of the variable will be plotted.
\item The \Field{X}, \Field{Y} and \Field{Z} fields allow
      you to define which variables will be used
      by the \Button{Plot} and \Button{Scan} buttons.
      These fields can be filled in two ways:
      firstly by typing the name or an expression of a variable;
      secondly by double-clicking in one of the \Field{X}, \Field{Y} or
      \Field{Z} fields. In the latter
      case the field pointed at is filled with the variable highligted in
      the list of variables.
\item Defines the first row used in the Ntuple when the \Button{Plot}
      or \Button{Project} buttons are pressed.
\item Defines the number of rows used (starting from \Field{First Row}) when the
      \Button{Plot} or \Button{Project} buttons are pressed.

\section{\KUIP/\MOTIF{} Panel Interface}

   The PANEL Interface allows to define command sequences which are executed
   when the corresponding button is pressed (like \Lit{STYLE GP} in \XPAW/\Xxi).
   The command sequence

\begin{verbatim}
      PANEL 0
      PANEL 4.06 'some string'
      PANEL 0 D 'This is my first panel' 500x300+500+600
\end{verbatim}

   creates a panel with 4 rows and 6 columns of buttons.  The text 'some
   string' should be long enough to fit the longest command Sequence which
   should be put onto one of the buttons.  The 'PANEL 0 D' command defines the
   title and the window size and coordinates in the form WxH+X+Y.

   The panels can be edited interactively:

   - Clicking with the right mouse button on an empty panel button the user
   will be asked to give a definition to this button.

   - Clicking with the left mouse button on a panel button removes its
   definition.

   The PANEL commands needed to recreate a panel can be saved into a macro
file by pressing the ``Save Panel'' button.  Panels can be reloaded either by
executing the command 'PANEL 0 D' or by pressing the ``Command Panel'' button
   in the ``View'' menu of the \EW{} and entering the corresponding
   file name.

\section{X resources for for \KUIP/\MOTIF}

   This is a list of the X resources available to any \KUIP/\MOTIF{} based
   application (e.g. \PAWPP).  Resources control the appearance and behavior of
   an application.

   Users can specify their own values for these resources in the standard
   \Xxi/\MOTIF{} way (via the .Xdefaults file or a file in the
   /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults directory). One just has to prefix the desired
   resource by the class name of the application.

   To customize \PAWPP, for instance, all the resources have to be prefixed
   with \Lit{Paw++} or they should be stored in the file
   /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Paw++.

   Any default values specified by \KUIP{} are given behind the resource name.
