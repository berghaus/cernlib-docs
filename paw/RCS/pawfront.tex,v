\chapter*{About this guide}
 
\section*{Preliminary remarks}
 
In this tutorial
examples are in \Lit{monotype face} and strings to be input by the user
are \Ucom{underlined}.
In the index the page where a command is defined is in {\bf bold},
page numbers where a routine is referenced are in normal type.
 
\section*{Acknowledgements}
 
The authors of PAW would like to thank all their colleagues who, by their
continuous interest and encouragement, have given them the
necessary input to provide a modern and easy to use
data analysis and presentation system.
 
Vladimir Berezhnoi (IHEP, Serpukhov, USSR), the main author of the
Fortran interpreter COMIS, provided one of the essential components
of our system.
Nicole Cremel has collaborated to the first versions of HPLOT.
The PAW/HBOOK to MINUIT interface has been implemented in
collaboration with Eliane Lessner (FNAL, USA) and Fred James.
Jim Loken (Oxford, UK) has been our expert on VAX global
sections.
David Foster, Frederic Hemmer, Catherine Magnin and Ben Segal
have contributed to the development of the PAW TCP/IP interface.
Ben has also largely contibuted to the TELNETG and 3270G systems.
Per Scharff-Hansen and Johannes Raab from the OPAL
collaboration have made possible the interface with the OS9 system.
Harald Johnstad (SSC, USA) and Lee Roberts (FNAL, USA)
have contributed to the debugging phases of PAW in the DI3000 and
DECGKS environments.
Initial implementations of PAW on MVS/TSO, the Sun and the
DEC Station 3100 were made by  Alain Michalon (Strasbourg, France),
Fran\c{c}ois Marabelle (Saclay, France)
and Walter Bruckner (Heidelberg, FRG), respectively.
Lionel Cons has contributed to
the implementation of the selection mechanisms for Ntuples.
Isabelle Moulinier (Paris) has been working, as a summer student,
on various improvements in the HIGZ/HPLOT packages.
