\section*{Acknowledgments}                                           

Many people participated in the design and the implementation of \KUIP{}.
The first version of \KUIP{} released in 1987 was designed and
implemented by Ren\'e Brun and Pietro Zanarini. 
Many basic features stem from the package ZCEDEX\cite{bib-ZCEDEX}, 
implemented at CERN in 1982 by R.\,Brun, C.\,Kersters, D.\,Moffat and
A.\,Petrilli, which offered already command parsing, macros, vectors,
and functions.  

The development of \KUIP{} was started in the context of \PAW{},
the \textem{Physics Analysis Workstation} project, and therefore
everybody in the \PAW{} team must be acknowledged.
Olivier Couet implemented the graphics menus and the
graphics interface of \KUIP{} to \HIGZ{}.
Achille Petrilli, Fons Rademakers, and Federico Carminati wrote the
original routines for break interception on various platforms.
Carlo Vandoni integrated the functionality of \SIGMA{}\cite{bib-SIGMA} 
(\textem{System for Interactive Mathematical Applications}).
Colin Caughie (Edinburgh) implemented new features in 
macro flow control. 
Ilias Goulas (Turin) provided \KUIB{} (\KUIP{} Interface Builder) as a
replacement for the original \KUIPC{} (\KUIP{} Compiler).
Alain Michalon (Strasbourg) and Harald Butenschoen (DESY) ported
\KUIP{} to the MVS/TSO and NEWLIB environments.
Valeri Fine (Dubna) ported \KUIP{} to MSDOS and Windows/NT.
C.W.\,Hobbs (DEC) provided the terminal communication routines for the
VMS version of \KUIPMotif{}.

The maintenance of the overall package and developments for the basic
part and KUIPC is in the hands of Alfred Nathaniel.
Nicole Cremel is responsible for the \KUIP{} interface to \OSFMotif{}.
Fons Rademakers was in charge of the overall maintenance before
that and made many important contributions to the \KUIPMotif{} interface.


\section*{About this manual}
 
Many features described in this manual edition are available only since the
\Lit{94b} release of the CERN libraries.
For example, there were many enhancements added to the macro interpreter.

The coding of some features (e.g.\ global variables) did not meet the
deadline for the \Lit{94b} release.  
They are already documented here with the remark that they are
implemented only \Lit{95a} pre-release in the \Lit{new} area.

Therefore, if you find something described in this manual does not
work in your program, please check that you are using an up-to-date
version of \KUIP{}.

The manual is structured in the following way:
\begin{UL}
\item
Chapter~1 gives a short overview of what \KUIP{} is doing.
\item
Chapter~2 is intended for all application \textem{users} describing
the user interface provided by \KUIP{}. 
\end{UL}
The remaining parts of the manual are intended for application
\textem{writers}:
\begin{UL}
\item
Chapter~3 describes in the first part how to define the commands to be
handled by the application.
The second part explains how to use the features provided by \KUIPMotif{}.
\item
Chapter~4 is a reference for the calling sequences of \KUIP{}
routines.
\item
Chapter~5 is a reference for \KUIP{} built-in commands.
\item
Appendix~A gives an example for a simple \KUIP{}-based application program.
\item
Appendix~B gives some useful information about the system dependencies 
in interfacing Fortran and~C.
\end{UL}

Throughout this manual we use \texttt{mono-type face} for examples.
Since \KUIP{} is mostly case-insensitive, we use \texttt{UPPERCASE} for
keywords while the illustrative parts are written in
\texttt{lowercase}.
When mixing program output and user-typed commands the user input is
\texttt{\underline{underlined}}.

In the index the page where a command or routine is defined is in {\bf bold},
page numbers where they are referenced are in normal type.

This document was produced using \LaTeX~\cite{bib-LATEX}
with the {\tt cernman} style option, developed at CERN. 
A PostScript file {\tt kuip.ps}, containing a printable version
of this manual, can be obtained by anonymous ftp as follows
(commands to be typed by the user are underlined):

Note that a printer with a fair amount of memory is needed in order to
print this manual.

There is a Usenet news group \texttt{cern.heplib} being the forum for
discussions about \KUIP{} and the other packages of the CERN program library.
Bug reports, requests for new features, and questions of general
interest should be sent there.
People without Usenet access can subscribe to a distribution list by
sending a mail to \Lit{listserv@@cernvm.cern.ch} containing the
