<H1 ID=H1DIST>Distributed PAW
<P>With the increasing number of workstations, it happens more and more
frequently that a user wants to run PAW on a mainframe
or on a workstation.
Several tools described in this chapter have been developed in order to use
in the most convenient way all the resources available in an heteregoneous
environment of workstations, superminis, data acquisition systems
and mainframes.

<P>Both ZFTP and real time access to histograms on a remote

on this computer. The PAW server is automatically started
from a PAW session, if PAW has been implemented with
the relevant options (PATCHY <BIBREF REFID=PATCHY> flag CZ).
PAW and the PAW server must be linked with two special modules
called <HP2>CZ</HP2> and <HP2>TCPAW</HP2> <BIBREF REFID='TCPAW1 TCPAW2'>.
<P><HP2>CZ</HP2> is a small FORTRAN package (about 300 lines). It provides
an interface between the ZEBRA Input/Output routines
and the high level transport routines of the TCPAW package.
<P><HP2>TCPAW</HP2><BIBREF REFID=TCPAW1>
is a networking package, written in C by Ben Segal (about 1500 lines).
It provides a very simple FORTRAN-callable interface to TCP/IP services.
It supports client and server modules running on UNIX, Apollo, VMS,
VM/CMS and OS9 environments. Small parts of TCPAW
are CERN specific but it would be perfectly possible
to transport it elsewhere with minor modifications. The package
currently requires the Wollongong (TWG) TCP/IP software
to be present on VMS connected systems, the IBM FAL 1.2 Product
on VM/CMS, and Microware TCP/IP on OS9. The UNIX systems
Ultrix, CRAY Unicos, SUN OS, IBM AIX, Apollo/Aegis, Apple A/UX and HP-UX
are supported as delivered.
<P>In the relatively near future it is intended to extend its functionality
to support DECNET as well as TCP/IP connections.

<P><FIGREF REFID=TELNETG page=NO> describes the functionality of these two programs. They allow
to run a graphics application based on HIGZ (e.g. PAW, GEANT, etc.) on a host
machine and to receive the graphics output on the local machine. TELNETG is
designed to work with operating systems supporting a command line interface
and 3270G for a full screen interface.
<P>TELNETG and 3270G supports both graphics Input and Output. The graphics
locator (commands LOCATE, VLOCATE, etc.) as well as the various KUIP graphics menu
styles (G and GP) may be used.
<P>Both programs exploit the fact that the HIGZ macro primitives are very
compact, therefore reducing the amount of information to be sent through
the network. Compared to more conventional emulators (4014, 4207, etc.)
gains in speed are typically a factor of 10 when drawing one-dimensional histograms
and may reach a factor 100 for two-dimensional plots (lego, surface, scatterplot).
<P>TELNETG combines a slightly modified version of the standard TELNET
program written in the C language and an interface to the HIGZ system written in FORTRAN.
<P>The following example shows how to use TELNETG from an Apollo to a VAX.
The integer identifier of the workstation type  must be preceded by a

<I1>ZFTP
The ZFTP program (ZEBRA File Transfer Program) provides the same functionality
<I1>TELNET
as the <XPH>FTP</XPH> program which is available like <XPH>TELNET</XPH> on
all workstations
and mainframes supporting TCP/IP. In addition ZFTP has been optimized
to allow the transfer of ZEBRA binary files both sequential and direct access.
<P>
<I1>ZEBRA RZ file
The direct access ZEBRA/RZ files (used for HBOOK histograms and HIGZ pictures)
contain data in the local data representation. Because ZEBRA is an object
oriented language supporting machine independent Input/Output, ZFTP is able
to translate in flight all the ZEBRA data structures in a transparent way
in the network buffers. ZFTP copies the RZ files on the local machine
with the same parameters (RECL, quota, etc.) than on the remote machine.
The original date and time of the objects is also preserved.
<P>
In addition to binary file transfer, ZFTP can also transfer alphanumeric
text files (up to 80 characters/line). On IBM/VM-CMS, these files must be
of type <XPH>RECFM=F,LRECL=80</XPH>.
<P>
The ZFTP user interface is based on KUIP and is the same on all systems.
If several files have to be transferred (maybe on a regular basis),
KUIP macros may be used. The following commands are available:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>OPEN
<DD>To start a communication with a remote machine.
<DT>CLOSE
<DD>Close the current communication.
<DT>GETA

<I1>RSHELL
<I1>RLOGIN
When running PAW on a workstation, it is often necessary to access files
(e.g. HBOOK files) which reside on a different computer. The ZFTP program described
above can be used if a very frequent access to the file is required. But a
more convenient mechanism for direct access is the possibility to access the file directly.
In order to do that, PAW uses a conventional Client/Server model. The client
(PAW) runs on the workstation. When the PAW command RLOGIN is invoked,
a PAW server is automatically started on the remote machine. This server
is watching for client messages.
<P>
Once the <XPH>RLOGIN REMOTE</XPH> command has been executed, the PAW Current Directory
is set to <XPH>//REMOTE</XPH>. The PAW client can now instruct the PAW server to
attach a file using the <XPH>RSHELL</XPH> command (e.g. <XPH>rshell file pawtest.dat</XPH>). If an
histogram with HBOOK ID=10 is on the remote file, than the PAW command
<XPH>Histo/Plot 10</XPH>
will plot this histogram on the local workstation. The histogram resides
on <XPH>//PAWC</XPH> like other histograms coming from local files.
<P>The RSHELL command may be used to communicate with the PAW server.
The expression typed following <XPH>RSHELL</XPH> is passed to the server. The current
implementation of the PAW server recognizes the following commands:
<DL TSIZE=25 COMPACT>
<DT>rshell file filename
<DD>Server connects filename
<DT>rshell cdir //lun11
<DD>Server changes current directory
<DT>rshell ld
<DD>Server lists current directory
<DT>rshell ld //
<DD>Server lists all connected files
<DT>rshell message
<DD>Server pass message to operating system

<I1>VMS
<I1>presenter
In addition to the facilities described in the previous section,
the standard version of PAW may be used as an online presenter
on VMS systems using the mechanism of global sections.
It is possible for two processes to reference the same histograms using
<HP2>global sections</HP2>.
<I1>global section
<I1>VAX/VMS
For example, the first process may be a <HP2>histogram producer</HP2>
(e.g. a monitoring task) and the second process  <HP2>PAW</HP2>.
As the
histograms are being gradually filled by the first task, PAW can
view them, and even reset them.
To use the global sections, it is also necessary to <Q>page align</Q> the common
which is in the global section. This is achieved in the <Q>link step</Q> when making
the process (see example).
The relevant statements are <XPH>SYS$INPUT/OPTIONS</XPH>
to tell the linker that some options follow the link statement,
and <XPH>PSECT=PAWC,PAGE</XPH> which is the option to
page align the <XPH>/PAWC/</XPH> common.
