<PREFACE>About this guide
<H2>Preliminary remarks
<P>This <HP2>Complete Reference</HP2> of
PAW (for <HP2>P</HP2>hysics <HP2>A</HP2>nalysis
<HP2>W</HP2>orkstation), consists of three parts:
<OL>
<LI>A <HP2>step by step</HP2> tutorial introduction to the system.
<LI>A <HP2>functional description</HP2> of the components.
<LI>A <HP2>reference guide</HP2>, describing each command in detail.
</OL>
<P>The PAW system is implemented on various mainframes and personal
workstations. In particular versions exist for IBM&nbsp;VM/CMS and MVS/TSO,
VAX/VMS and various Unix-like platforms, such as APOLLO,
DEC&nbsp;Station&nbsp;3100 and SUN.
<LBLBOX>Notation
Throughout this manual, data or commands to be <HP2>entered</HP2>

<H2>Acknowledgements
<P>
The authors of PAW would like to thank all their colleagues who, by their
continuous interest and encouragement, have given them the
necessary input to provide a modern and easy to use
data analysis and presentation system.
<P>They are particularly grateful to Michel Goossens
as main author of part 1 and as technical
editor of the present document.
<P>Vladimir Berezhnoi (IHEP, Serpukhov, USSR), the main author of the
Fortran interpreter COMIS, provided one of the essential components
of our system.
Nicole Cremel has collaborated to the first versions of HPLOT.
The PAW/HBOOK to MINUIT interface has been implemented in
collaboration with Eliane Lessner (FNAL, USA) and Fred James.
Jim Loken (Oxford, UK) has been our expert on VAX global
sections.
David Foster, Frederic Hemmer, Catherine Magnin and Ben Segal
have contributed to the development of the PAW TCP/IP interface.
Ben has also largely contibuted to the TELNETG and 3270G systems.
Per Scharff-Hansen and Johannes Raab from the OPAL
collaboration have made possible the interface with the OS9 system.
Harald Johnstad (FNAL, now SSC, USA) and Lee Roberts (FNAL, USA)
have contributed to the debugging phases of PAW in the DI3000 and
DECGKS environments.
Initial implementations of PAW on MVS/TSO, the Sun and the
DEC Station 3100 were made by  Alain Michalon (Strasbourg, France),
Fran&ccedil;ois Marabelle (Saclay, France)
and Walter Bruckner (Heidelberg, FRG), respectively.
Lionel Cons (now at ENSIMAG, Grenoble) has contributed to
the implementation of the selection mechanisms for Ntuples.
Isabelle Moulinier (Paris) has been working, as a summer student,
on various improvements in the HIGZ/HPLOT packages.
Federico Carminati, the main distributor of the CERN
program library had to suffer from the many imperfections of our
first releases. His collaboration for PAW consultancy is
appreciated.
Gudrun Benassi has always kindly organized the distribution
of the various PAW manuals.
<P>This document has been produced using
a SGML<BIBREF REFID=SGMLDCF> tagging scheme,
the BOOKMASTER<BIBREF REFID=BOOKMAS> macros and the
IBM SCRIPT/DCF<BIBREF REFID='DCFUSER DCFGUID'>&nbsp;
text-processing system on VM/CMS.
All pictures shown are produced with PAW and are included in
PostScript<BIBREF REFID=POSTSCR> format in the manual.
