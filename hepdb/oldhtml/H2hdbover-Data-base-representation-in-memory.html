<P>
The HEPDB package uses a Zebra dynamic store (which is in fact a Fortran
labelled common block). This can be any of the stores used by the
application program. HEPDB operates inside two divisions in that store: a
HEPDB system division, of no concern for the user, and the division where,
at user's request, the data objects are dumped from the random access
medium and kept in memory as long as required by the user.
<P>
In the latter division, data objects from a given data base file are
stored as Zebra banks, or Zebra data structures, within a main data
structure which reproduces, partially and only for the directories in use,
the Node/Key structure of the data base files. As many main structures can
be simultaneously handled in memory as there are data base files declared
by the user; however, they are expected to all share the same division.
The skeleton of NODE and KEY banks grows up, following the successive user
requests, and stays permanently available in memory. The data banks,
appended to the corresponding KEY banks, can be either refreshed when the
time dependence of their contents requires it, or dropped when they are no
longer needed by the user. They can also be marked as temporarily
unwanted, so that the system can drop them in case of shortage of memory,
at the cost of reaccessing them from the random access device if and when
required again.
