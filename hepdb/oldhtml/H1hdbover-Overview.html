<P>
High Energy Physics experiments require the use of powerful data base
systems in which to store information such as detector geometry and
calibration constants. The data stored usually consist of a part which is
largely time independent, for instance the parameters which describe the
experimental setup, and of another part whose contents may vary with time,
with different frequencies, and have therefore to be recorded repeatedly,
with proper time or other validity ranges.
<P>
The latter may represent quite a large amount of data. As an example, for
a LEP Detector, one has to store between tens and hundreds of megabytes of
data per year of operation.
<P>
At program execution time, fast access to the data base contents is
essential, and an efficient system which limits the rate of transactions
between the directly addressable storage medium, where the data base
resides, and the computer memory available to the user, has to be
implemented.
<P>
In a multi-user, multi-computer environment, keeping up to date a
centralized data base and optimizing the data flow is not a trivial
matter. This can only be achieved through dedicated 'service' machines
under control of a data base 'server'.
<P>
Last, but not least, the system has to be robust and safe, and equipped
with facilities which minimize the inconveniences of a possible program
crash or of a computer hang-up.
<P>
The package HEPDB, described in this manual, is an attempt to solve the
above requirements. It has greatly benefitted from similar packages
developed by other experiments at CERN and elsewhere, notably the DBL3 and
OPCAL packages, written by the L3 and OPAL collaborations respectively.
The DBL3 package is described in <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-DBL3>[bib-DBL3]</A>.
<P>
HEPDB is based on the ZEBRA system <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-ZEBRA>[bib-ZEBRA]</A> and relies heavily on
the Random Access I/O package RZ <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-ZEBRARZ>[bib-ZEBRARZ]</A>, and also MZ
(memory management) <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-ZEBRAMZ>[bib-ZEBRAMZ]</A>, DZ (debug and
dump) <A HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-ZEBRADZ>[bib-ZEBRADZ]</A> and
FZ (sequential I/O) <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-ZEBRAFZ>[bib-ZEBRAFZ]</A> packages.
<P>
The choice of the ZEBRA RZ package as a subsystem on which to build HEPDB
was natural, as it is used by other widely used programs such as GEANT <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-GEANT3>[bib-GEANT3]</A>, HBOOK <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-HBOOK>[bib-HBOOK]</A>, PAW <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-PAW>[bib-PAW]</A> and FATMEN <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-FATMEN>[bib-FATMEN]</A>. The ZEBRA package
provides all of basic features required for the HEPDB system, including
interchange mechanism (which in fact uses ZEBRA FZ sequential exchange
mode files).
