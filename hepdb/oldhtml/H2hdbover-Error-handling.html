<H2><A NAME=H2hdbover-Error-handling.html>Error handling</A></H2>
<P>
All HEPDB routines have an integer return code IRC as last argument. If,
on return, this contains the value zero then the routine was successful. A
non-zero return code indicates an error. The error codes may be translated
to a meaningful error message using the routine <A NAME=CDERR40> CDERR</A>. An explicit message
is printed out when the debug log level has been set to 1 or a higher
value, through a call to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Utility-routines.html#CDLOGL NAME=CDLOGL41> CDLOGL</A> (the debug level is set by default to 0 in
<A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDOPEN NAME=CDOPEN42> CDOPEN</A>).
<P>
Some routines return additional status information in the Zebra common
block <TT>/QUEST/IQUEST(100)</TT>. However, the user is not required to
test on the values of the <TT>IQUEST</TT> vector on return.
