One may avoid running a local database server on a given node by accessing
the database files over the network. This is the recommended procedure for
Unix systems at CERN. To enable this, one should first mount the /hepdb
file system as shown below.

On a VAX/VMS system that has the NFS client software installed, as is the
case on VXCERN, the following commands are issued at system startup time.

<P>
The HEPDB software automatically uses C I/O to access remote database
files on VMS systems. This is because VAX Fortran does not recognise the
file structure of the remote Unix database file but is in any case
completely transparent to the user.
<P>
It is currently recommended that the update directory reside on the local
VMS system. This is because Multinet NFS requires that VMS UICs are mapped
to Unix UID and GID pairs on the remote node, even if the remote directory
is world writable (or writable by others in Unix parlence). On VXCERN only
a single UIC is mapped to a valid UID/GID pair on node hepdb. A job runs
under this UIC to move the update files between the local and remote file
systems.
