Before storing any data, the user has to create a directory with all
specifications of the key vector. The routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Directory-manipulation.html#CDMDIR NAME=CDMDIR19> CDMDIR</A> permits the creation
of HEPDB standard directories, with any number of additional user keys.
The option 'P' (partitioned) can be used to create a partitioned
directory. The dictionary directory is automatically updated upon creation
of a new directory. In case the directories at the intermediate nodes do
not exist, <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Directory-manipulation.html#CDMDIR NAME=CDMDIR20> CDMDIR</A> will create them automatically with 9 integer keys. Even
if a directory is created as a non-partitioned directory it may be
converted at any time using the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Directory-manipulation.html#CDPART NAME=CDPART21> CDPART</A>.
