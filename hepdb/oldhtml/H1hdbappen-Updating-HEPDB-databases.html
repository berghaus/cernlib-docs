<P>
Several methods exist for updating HEPDB databases. Normally, updates are
not applied directly to the database itself but queued to a dedicated
server. The client-server communication also has several variants but the
most important is when the communication is via files. Only this method
will be described here as it is the only one enabled in the standard
CERNLIB distribution of the package.
<P>
When a user accesses a HEPDB database a journal file is opened in which
database modifications are written. This journal file is created in the
user's directory and is in Zebra FZ alpha exchange format. This file is
then moved to a queue directory upon request, when the user starts to
modify a different database or when the database is closed. The queue
directory is defined by a configuration file which is described in detail
below.
<P>
The journal file name contains information on which database the
modifications are for and the user and node name from which the update
originated.
<P>
The above scheme works well in both localised and distributed environments
and is designed with file systems such as NFS and DFS in mind. In the case
of nodes which do not offer network file systems, journal files are
transferred using the CERN Program Library package CSPACK <A
