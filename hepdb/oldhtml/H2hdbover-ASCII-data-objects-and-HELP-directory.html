<P>
ASCII files, with up to 80 characters per record, may be stored in the
database. An example of the use of such a facility is for Production
Control, when the logs of individual production jobs are stored in the
database. Another example is related to the storage of help information in
a special HELP directory generated at the top level when a data base file
is created. HELP directories do not make use of the standard keys. One key
is used to specify the node to which the help information is relevant.
