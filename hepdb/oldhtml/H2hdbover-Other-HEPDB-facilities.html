<H2><A NAME=H2hdbover-Other-HEPDB-facilities.html>Other HEPDB facilities</A></H2>
<P>
In this section a few other user callable subroutines of general interest
are mentioned, as well as some additional facilities which extend the
functionality of the HEPDB package and make it more user friendly.
<P>
<H3>Print and trace-back</H3>
<P>
The user can print the contents of a directory with the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Utility-routines.html#CDLDIR NAME=CDLDIR46> CDLDIR</A>,
only the keys with the option 'K' (keys), or both the data and the keys
with the option 'D' (data).
<P>
The user can print the summary of data base usage through the routine
<A HREF=H2hdbuser-Utility-routines.html#CDSTAT NAME=CDSTAT47> CDSTAT</A>. The summary consists of the numbers of calls to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE48> CDUSE</A> and actual
disk accesses, for each set of user key values.
<P>
Information on the data objects used in a given program execution can be
obtained through the routine <A NAME=CDRINFO49> CDRINFO</A>.
<H3>Time related routines</H3>
<P>
Two sets of routines are available to pack/unpack the date and time
to/from one single word - the routines <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Utility-routines.html#CDPKTM NAME=CDPKTM50> CDPKTM</A> and <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Utility-routines.html#CDUPTM NAME=CDUPTM51> CDUPTM</A> for times
accurate to one minute and <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Utility-routines.html#CDPKTS NAME=CDPKTS52> CDPKTS</A> and <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Utility-routines.html#CDUPTS NAME=CDUPTS53> CDUPTS</A> when one second accuracy is
required.
<P>
The maximum of the start validity and the minimum of the end validity of
all data base objects used in a given program execution can be obtained
through the routine <A NAME=CDVALID54> CDVALID</A>.
<P>
The insertion time of the last inserted object in a given directory can be
enquired through the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Utility-routines.html#CDLKEY NAME=CDLKEY55> CDLKEY</A>, and the time when a directory has
been last modified, through the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Utility-routines.html#CDLMOD NAME=CDLMOD56> CDLMOD</A>.
<P>
<H3>Purging operations</H3>
<P>
With the automatic updating mode, deleting data objects from a given
directory is rather critical, because of the possibility of deleting a
master object and leaving alive its updated version(s). Therefore, any
direct call to RZ deletion routines should be avoided. The operation can
be taken care of by the routines <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Deleting-information-from-the-database.html#CDPURK NAME=CDPURK57> CDPURK</A> and <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Deleting-information-from-the-database.html#CDPURG NAME=CDPURG58> CDPURG</A>. The latter provides a
wide range of actions through a number of character options, while <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Deleting-information-from-the-database.html#CDPURK NAME=CDPURK59> CDPURK</A>
can be used to purge data objects with selection on user keys like <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE60> CDUSE</A>.
<P>
The user can delete a complete tree of directory starting from a given
node, using the routine <A NAME=CDDELT61> CDDELT</A>. In the situation where a normal directory
has been 'a posteriori' partitioned, through the use of <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Directory-manipulation.html#CDPART NAME=CDPART62> CDPART</A>, the user
should call <A NAME=CDDELT63> CDDELT</A> to delete the original directory.
<P>
With the routine <A NAME=CDPURGP64> CDPURGP</A>, it is possible to delete all but the last few
partitions, as specified by the user, from a partitioned directory.
<P>
The user can delete all but a few directory trees from the data base using
the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Directory-manipulation.html#CDKEEP NAME=CDKEEP65> CDKEEP</A>.
