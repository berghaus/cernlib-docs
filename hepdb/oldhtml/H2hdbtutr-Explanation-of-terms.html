<P>
HEPDB is based upon the ZEBRA RZ package. Thus data is accessed or stored
using a UNIX-like pathname, plus one or more identifiers known as keys.
<P>
For example in the use of HEPDB to store and retrieve calibration
constants for some experimental sub-detector the aforementioned pathname
would be the name of the sub-detector and the keys would provide the
selection of a particular calibration.
