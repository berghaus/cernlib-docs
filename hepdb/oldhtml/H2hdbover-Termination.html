<P>
The user should always close the data base files at the end of the job,
through a call to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDEND NAME=CDEND43> CDEND</A>. This routine closes all the RZ files opened
during the session, or just a single file, depending on the options
specified. The user should not make reference to any HEPDB routines (other
than <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDOPEN NAME=CDOPEN44> CDOPEN</A> !) after the call to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDEND NAME=CDEND45> CDEND</A>.
