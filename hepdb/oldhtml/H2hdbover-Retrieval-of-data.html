<P>
The user can retrieve Zebra data structures from any directory on a disk
file into memory through the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE25> CDUSE</A>. The data objects are selected
according to the given directory pathname and to the contents of the key
vector. Selection is made on the pairs of validity ranges and on the
specific user keys selected, if any. If not yet done, the routine creates
in memory a tree structure of NODE banks, according to the pathname
elements. At the lowest node, <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE26> CDUSE</A> inserts the information relevant to
the keys in KEY banks (one or several, created as a linear chain at the
next-of-same-type link of the corresponding NODE banks) and the
information relevant to the data itself, in DATA banks supported by the
first link of the corresponding KEY banks. As a general rule, when <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE27> CDUSE</A>
finds that more than one data object satisfy the validity criteria, the
default action is to return the most recently inserted object that matches
the selection criteria. Special actions can however be taken, by using the
mask IMASK to select on values of system or standard user keys, such as
the source identifier or insertion time, or indeed any of the normal user
keys. If any element n of the vector IMASK is set, then only objects with
this key element equal to the corresponding element of the input key
vector will be selected. In the special case of the key pairs, setting
this element will select only objects with start validity less than, or
end validity greater than, the corresponding value specified in the input
selection vector ISEL. This permits selection of all objects valid before
or after a given run, event or time, depending on the key pair
definitions.
<P>
Independently, the user can set a global selection on insertion time,
through the routine <A NAME=CDBE428> CDBE4</A>, for instance to ignore modifications to the
data base past a certain date and be able to reproduce the conditions of a
previous program execution.
<P>
In some special cases, one may wish to retrieve all valid objects that
satisfy the specified selection criteria, and not just the most recently
inserted one. In this case, or if one wishes to make multiple selections
in a single call, the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSEM NAME=CDUSEM29> CDUSEM</A> should be used.
<P>
With the option 'K' (key), <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE30> CDUSE</A> also permits retrieval of the keys only,
without loading the data objects.
<P>
In case <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE31> CDUSE</A> finds that the required data objects already exist in
memory, it does not bother to transfer them again from disk.
<P>
For an optimum use of the memory, and in order to minimize the disk
accesses, the user should call the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Freeing-information-from-memory.html#CDFREE NAME=CDFREE32> CDFREE</A>, in conjunction with
<A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE33> CDUSE</A>. <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Freeing-information-from-memory.html#CDFREE NAME=CDFREE34> CDFREE</A> sets a flag in the specified KEY bank to signal that the
corresponding data object is no longer needed, until a subsequent call to
<A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE35> CDUSE</A> requires it again. The data object bank is not dropped immediately,
but only if and when any other call to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE36> CDUSE</A> need more space than
currently available in memory. If the 'frozen' data object has not been
dropped when it is required again, the flag is cleared and no further disk
transfer will take place.
<P>
To read data objects where ASCII information has been encoded, the user
can call <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Text-file-manipulation.html#CDTEXT NAME=CDTEXT37> CDTEXT</A>, similar to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Retrieving-information-from-the-database.html#CDUSE NAME=CDUSE38> CDUSE</A>, except that the logical unit number of
the file reserved to write the ASCII information has to be passed as an
argument.
<P>
Simple Fortran vectors may be stored and retrieved using the routine
<A HREF=H2hdbuser-Vector-manipulation.html#CDVECT NAME=CDVECT39> CDVECT</A>.
