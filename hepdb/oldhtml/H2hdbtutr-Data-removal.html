<H3>Deletion based on a key vector</H3>
<P>
To allow deletion of object from the database based upon a user specified
key vector HEPDB provides the user callable routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Deleting-information-from-the-database.html#CDPURK NAME=CDPURK102> CDPURK</A>. Once again as
in the call to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Storing-information-in-the-database.html#CDSTOR NAME=CDSTOR103> CDSTOR</A> discussed earlier the user sets up a key vector of
size enough to hold all system, special user, validity and normal user
keys and fills in the required elements for the envisaged deletion. The
user then creates another vector (in our example to follow it is called
IMASK ) which acts as a mask specifying which elements of our key vector
are to be considered in the deletion operation (this is set by the element
taking a non-zero value).
<P>
Note also that the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Deleting-information-from-the-database.html#CDPURK NAME=CDPURK104> CDPURK</A> can be used to `undelete' previously
deleted objects. The specification of the object to be restored is the
same as that of deleting an object. To perform the undelete operation the
user simply specifies character option 'U'.
