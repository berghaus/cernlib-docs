<H2><A NAME=H2hdbtutr-Opening-a-database.html>Opening a database</A></H2>
Now we can check that a database exists via the HEPDB interactive
interface. (Later we show how to open a database via a HEPDB-calling
FORTRAN program).
<P>
The following section gives a little detail upon the invocation of the
interactive interface.
<P>
<H3>Invoking the HEPDB interactive interface</H3>
<P>
The interactive interface is invoked by typing hepdb. Note that the
variable CDSERV must be set, specifying the directory where the
appropriate HEPDB configuration file is stored.
<P>
When you log on to the system you may notice messages saying that macros
xxxSYS, xxxGRP, xxxUSR, and xxxLOGON are not present. This is a normal
response and refers to a HEPDB facility which allows you to execute a
standard set of macros on entry to the interactive interface. The
following section explains how the use of these macros is envisaged.
<P>
<H3>Using start up macros</H3>
<P>
The use of a subroutine KULOGN is as follows:
<P>

                                  </PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
      SUBROUTINE KULOGN (CHPACK,CHOPT)
*
*    Execute logon kumacs for package `CHPACK' with options `CHOPT'
*    KUMACs are xxxSYS, xxxGRP, xxxUSR and xxxLOGON
*
</PRE>
<P>
Depending on the platform you are running different ways of tailoring
where the macros reside are available. The search methods used by the
various platforms are as follows:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>VAX/VMS
   Look in directories defined in searchlist xxxPATH ,if xxxPATH not
       defined, use SYS$LOGIN, SYS$DISK:[] (i.e. current and home
       directories).
<LI>Unix
   Look in path xxx PATH (If not defined, use current and home
       directories).
<LI>VM/CMS
   Check disks in xxxPATH. If this is not defined default to using the A
       disk.
</UL>
<P>
The standard set of macros currently supported by HEPDB are intended for
the following use:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>xxxSYS
   This macro may contain a call to a monitoring program
<LI>xxxGRP
   This macro would contain commands specific to a particular group.
<LI>xxxUSR and xxxLOGON
   These two macros are intended to hold user specific information. As
       the default search order is the current and then home directory,
       one may use one macro, e.g. HDBUSR for general commands, e.g.
       creation of standard aliases etc. and the other, e.g. HDBLOGON for
       directory specific commands.
</UL>

<H3>Opening a database interactively</H3>
<P>
HEPDB allows a database file to be opened via the OPEN command. The OPEN
command must be given with the two character prefix of the database
followed (optionally) by the databases' physical file name. The example
below shows how to open a file interactively and the terminal output you
can expect.

<P>
To demonstrate that the file has now been opened you can issue another
HEPDB interactive command FILES, which shows a list of all files currently
open to HEPDB.

Finally the database should now be closed. This can be done in two ways,
explicitly via the CLOSE command if you wish to do more work with HEPDB
during the current session or implicitly via the QUIT command if you wish
to terminate the current HEPDB session. An example of the first of these
cases follows:

<H3>Opening a database from FORTRAN</H3>
<P>
Below is an example section of FORTRAN code showing how HEPDB's user
callable routines can be used to open a database file. Notice how the two
character id code of the database is used in the call to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDPREF NAME=CDPREF67> CDPREF</A> to obtain
the full file name and top directory name of the required database. This
information is then used by the call to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDOPEN NAME=CDOPEN68> CDOPEN</A> which then opens the file.
Finally note the use of <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDEND NAME=CDEND69> CDEND</A> this is the method of closing the database
file. (The character option `A' signifies that all files should be
closed.)
