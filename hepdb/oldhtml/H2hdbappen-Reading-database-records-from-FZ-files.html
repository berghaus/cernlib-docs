An FZ file created using the routine <A HREF=H2hdbappen-Converting-database-records-into-an-FZ-file.html#HDBTOFZ NAME=HDBTOFZ372> HDBTOFZ</A> or the routines <A HREF=H2hdbappen-Merging-databases-or-database-records.html#HDBMERG NAME=HDBMERG373> HDBMERG</A> or
<A NAME=HDBFRRZ375> HDBFRRZ</A>. In the
special case that the FZ file contains the contents of a complete
database, using the option <A NAME=HDBTOFZ377> HDBTOFZ</A>, a new database file should be
created using the routine <A NAME=HDBNEW378> HDBNEW</A> before calling this routine. In all other
cases, the data is entered into the subdirectory specified by the path
<A NAME=PATH379> PATH</A>, or else the subdirectory tree stored is added at the level specified
by the path <A NAME=PATH380> PATH</A>. This routine may also be used to process FZ files that
are not written by one of the HEPDB routines. For example, an FZ file
containing a single datastructure may be read in and entered into the
database in the directory specified by the variable <A NAME=PATH381> PATH</A> with the period
of validity as specified by <TT>ISEL</TT>.
<P>
Clearly, if the FZ file contains a database or directory tree, the
validity of the recovered records is the same as those originally stored.
However, when the FZ file contains a single record extracted from a
database previously, or a completely new ZEBRA structure, then the
validity may be specified. If the validity has been stored with the
record, then this may be retrieved and applied. If the record contains a
start-of-run record, the option <A NAME=R382> R</A> must be used.
