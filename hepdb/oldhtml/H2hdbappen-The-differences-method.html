In addition to the above two methods, one can also store the difference of
the current object from a master. A comparison is made with the five
nearest neighbours which are not themselves updates. The differences are
then made against that neighbour for which the minimum number of words are
required. The user may select that the user keys must also match during
the search for nearest neighbours.
