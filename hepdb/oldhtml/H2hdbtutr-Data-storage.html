<TITLE>HEPDB -- H2hdbtutr-Data-storage </TITLE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME=H2hdbtutr-Data-storage.html>Data storage</A></H2>
<P>
This section explains how information can be entered into database and how
to retrieve or delete information.
<P>
Under HEPDB the user can store data structures created under the ZEBRA
system in the database. These ZEBRA data structures can range from a
single ZEBRA bank through to a complex ZEBRA data structure. When data is
submitted for inclusion to the database the pathname of the directory
where the data is to reside and the key vector must also be supplied.
<P>
HEPDB also provides facilities for the storage of other data types. Note
that the data is always converting into ZEBRA banks, but that this
conversion is automatic and transparent to the user. These facilities
include the routines <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Text-file-manipulation.html#CDTEXT NAME=CDTEXT82> CDTEXT</A>, <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Text-file-manipulation.html#CDCHAR NAME=CDCHAR83> CDCHAR</A> and <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Vector-manipulation.html#CDVECT NAME=CDVECT84> CDVECT</A> which allow the storage of
text files , character data and vectors respectively.
<P>
<H3>Storing a ZEBRA data structure</H3>
<P>
Providing the directory in which the data is to reside in has already been
created and the data structure is already in memory the user can store the
data in memory to disk by use of the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Storing-information-in-the-database.html#CDSTOR NAME=CDSTOR85> CDSTOR</A>. A demonstration of
this routine is shown in the above program to convert an existing RZ
database.
<P>
<H3>The storage of text file data</H3>
<P>
Whilst discussing HEPDB's storage facilities we shall examine briefly how
the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Text-file-manipulation.html#CDTEXT NAME=CDTEXT86> CDTEXT</A> allows us to store text files under HEPDB. It achieves
this by converting a text file to or from a ZEBRA structure suitable for
storage under HEPDB.
<P>
Suppose we had a file (for this examples sake residing on VM) that we
wished to store under HEPDB. Assuming the name of the file was TEST TEXT
A1 we could use a call similar to the following to retrieve the file from
disk and to return the address of the ZEBRA bank now containing it ready
for insertion to the database.
<P>

*     LUN for textfile access
*
      TXLUN=10
*
      CALL CDTEXT(TXLUN,'TEST.TEXT.A1',PATH,LBANK,'R',IRC)
</PRE>
<P>
The character option 'R' intructs the <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Text-file-manipulation.html#CDTEXT NAME=CDTEXT87> CDTEXT</A> routine to read the file from
disk. In this case the bank address will be returned in LBANK.
<P>
<H3>Storage of character based data</H3>
<P>
The storage of character based data is performed by the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Text-file-manipulation.html#CDCHAR NAME=CDCHAR88> CDCHAR</A>
which has similar functionality to the previously described <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Text-file-manipulation.html#CDTEXT NAME=CDTEXT89> CDTEXT</A>
routine, except that the data is moved from and to character arrays rather
than text files.
<P>
<H3>Storage of vector based data</H3>
<P>
Once again the storage of vector data is allowed by converting vectors to
the ZEBRA bank format before committing that bank to the database. The
routine available for this operation is <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Vector-manipulation.html#CDVECT NAME=CDVECT90> CDVECT</A>.
<P>
To demonstrate this imagine that one of the example databases we wish to
convert from the RZ format currently consists not of ZEBRA banks but of
FORTRAN integer vectors.
<P>
The conversion program must now read in the vectors and convert them to a
HEPDB format before they can be stored in the database. The code shown
below offers a suggestion of how the previous conversion program could be
modified to handle this storage of vectors.
