This is similar to the above, except that the journal file is written to a
special tohepdb directory on the local VMS system. A batch job
periodically scans this directory and copies any files found over NFS to
hepdb. Once again, once the update has been processed the new journal file
is copied back and placed in the todo directory of the local VMS slave
server.

system</H2>
<P>
This is the same as for the CERNVM case, except that the names file on the
remote system points to CDHEPDB at CERNVM, rather than simply CDHEPDB.
