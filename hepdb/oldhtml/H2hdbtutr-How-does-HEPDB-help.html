<P>
HEPDB helps solve problems in the above areas by providing the user with a
selection of FORTRAN callable subroutines for the storage and retrieval of
ZEBRA data structures, FORTRAN vectors and text files. Additionally there
are facilities for help manipulation, aliases for directory names and
mnemonic names for individual elements of the stored data.
<P>
Where appropriate these facilities are also provided through a KUIP based
interactive interface.
