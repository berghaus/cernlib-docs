<P>
On CERNVM a dedicated account is used per experiment. Thus for CPLEAR we
have the account CDCPLEAR, for CHORUS we have CDCHORUS. These accounts are
created using the standard USERREG procedure. Each account has 3
mini-disks plus a link to the 191 disk of the HEPDB machine. The latter is
used to store the various EXECs that are required for the servers, to
avoid cluttering up the CERNLIB disks.
<P>
The various disks are used as follows:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><TT>191</TT></DT><DD>Disk for the database files and log files
<DT><TT>192</TT></DT><DD>Link to HEPDB 191
<DT><TT>193</TT></DT><DD>Disk for journal files
<DT><TT>194</TT></DT><DD>Disk for bad files, i.e. those that cannot be
successfully processed.
</DL>
<P>
In addition there is a special server named CDHEPDB. This is used to
exchange journal files between node hepdb and CERNVM. It is also used as a
gateway to remote Bitnet sites. Thus, in the case of CPLEAR, updates from
the VM/CMS systems in Lyon, Saclay and Rutherford are first sent via
CDHEPDB to the master server on node hepdb. Once a unique key serial
number and the insertion date and time has been allocated, the new journal
files are then resent to the slave servers on those nodes and CERNVM.
<P>
The database servers are autologged by the machine FATONE, which also
controls the FATMEN servers.
