<P>
The user can store data from memory to disk with the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Storing-information-in-the-database.html#CDSTOR NAME=CDSTOR22> CDSTOR</A> , the
data in memory being simple Zebra banks or Zebra data structures. The
pathname of the directory as well as the key vector have to be supplied
when storing the data (the system keys 1-5 do not however need to be
filled in). In order to retain complete flexibility, the directory
structure must already have been created before an object is stored.
<P>
The contents of an ASCII file can converted into a packed, machine
independant format and stored in a ZEBRA bank suitable for storing in the
data base through the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Text-file-manipulation.html#CDTEXT NAME=CDTEXT23> CDTEXT</A>. This bank can then be stored in the
database using <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Storing-information-in-the-database.html#CDSTOR NAME=CDSTOR24> CDSTOR</A> as above.
