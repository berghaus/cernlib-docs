Fundamental to the operation of HEPDB is the concept of the database
server. Although other modes of operation exist, the normal way of
updating a HEPDB database is via a dedicated database server. The client,
or user, requests changes to the database using the HEPDB Fortran or KUIP
interface. These changes are not applied directly. Instead they are
written into a queue, which might simply be a directory or the VM spool.
Thus although the database files may be read by an unlimited number of
simulatenous users, they are only ever written by a single process - the
database server.
