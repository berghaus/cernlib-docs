The RZ package is not optimized for handling directories with large
numbers of data objects; the memory resident part of the data describing
the keys becomes very large and storage and retrieval become more
expensive, both in CPU time and real time, when the number of data objects
exceeds a few thousands. The concept of partitioned directory has been
introduced to attenuate these effects. Subdirectories are automatically
created when needed, with keys which permit to keep track of their
contents and to quickly access the right partition. Partitioning is
invisible to the user, who just has to give its characteristics when
creating the directory. Subsequent storage and retrieval of data objects
in a partitioned directory follow the same rules as for a normal
directory, as far as the calling sequences of the user interface
subroutines are concerned. It should be noted however that direct calls to
RZ routines for handling such directories would be extremely hazardous and
should be avoided.
To further optimize real time usage in storing data, HEPDB also provides a
facility to store several objects, belonging to the same directory, in one
pass. In real time, the gain is about proportional to the number of
objects one stores at once.
