<TITLE>HEPDB -- H2hdbover-Initialisation </TITLE>
<H2><A NAME=H2hdbover-Initialisation.html>Initialisation</A></H2>
<P>
The user must initialise the ZEBRA memory management system before calling
any of the HEPDB routines. This may either be done explicitly, e.g. via a
call to <A NAME=HLIMIT5> HLIMIT</A>. Alternatively,
the routine <A NAME=CDSTART6> CDSTART</A> may be used.
<P>
Then, for each data base file, a call to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDOPEN NAME=CDOPEN7> CDOPEN</A> initializes the HEPDB/RZ
control for the corresponding file. When using several data base files,
the user should be careful always to give the complete pathnames for all
subsequent references to the directories.
<P>
For an optimum usage of the RZ system, the user is advised to have a
reasonably large allocation for the system division. This is performed
automatically if the option <A NAME=CDOPEN9> CDOPEN</A>.
<P>
A unique numeric identifier is associated to every given top directory
(every file). The HEPDB package defines by default an identifier
increasing monotonically as the user makes the successive calls to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDOPEN NAME=CDOPEN10> CDOPEN</A>.
The choice of the identifier can however be imposed by the user, by
presetting <TT>IQUEST(1)</TT>, a Zebra short term communication variable,
to the desired value, before calling <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDOPEN NAME=CDOPEN11> CDOPEN</A>. The numeric identifier
assigned to each directory packed with that of the top directory, is
stored in the corresponding <TT>NODE</TT> bank. This permits to record in
a simple way which data objects have been used in a given program
execution.
<P>
The <TT>DICTIONARY</TT> directory, initially generated under control of
<A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDNEW NAME=CDNEW12> CDNEW</A>, is dumped into memory at every call to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDOPEN NAME=CDOPEN13> CDOPEN</A>. It can be expanded
at user's request to store mnemonics (up to 8 characters) for the elements
of the data objects. These are mainly used in HEPDB interactive
applications. For each directory, the mnemonics are stored in a data
object of the <TT>DICTIONARY</TT> directory, with key 1 set equal to the
numeric identifier of the corresponding directory. The routine which can
be used for entering or retrieving the information is <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Mnemonic-name-manipulation.html#CDNAME NAME=CDNAME14> CDNAME</A>. The aliases,
in the <TT>DICTIONARY</TT> directory, can be stored and retrieved through
the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Alias-manipulation.html#CDALIA NAME=CDALIA15> CDALIA</A>.
<P>
The HELP directory, also generated automatically under control of <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Initialisation-and-termination.html#CDNEW NAME=CDNEW16> CDNEW</A>,
at the time of creating the data base, is initially empty. The user should
enter the help information as an ASCII file through the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Help-manipulation.html#CDHELP NAME=CDHELP17> CDHELP</A>.
The content of the file is encoded as a computer independent single data
object with the key 1 set equal to the numeric identifier of the relevant
directory. The help information can be subsequently retrieved, decoded and
displayed, also through the routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Help-manipulation.html#CDHELP NAME=CDHELP18> CDHELP</A>.
