The following section for reasons of completeness describes how a
directory structure may be modified.

<H3>Deleting a directory via FORTRAN</H3>
<P>
To remove a directory via a FORTRAN program we make a call to the routine
<A HREF=H2hdbuser-Directory-manipulation.html#CDDDIR NAME=CDDDIR71> CDDDIR</A>. An outline of a program that would delete our DC directory is
shown below.

If we were now to issue another interactive TREE command we would notice
that the directory is no longer part of our database structure.
<P>
<H3>Multiple directory deletion</H3>
<P>
As well as allowing individual directories to be deleted HEPDB also allows
the deletion of multiple directories via the <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Directory-manipulation.html#CDKEEP NAME=CDKEEP72> CDKEEP</A> routine. As the name
suggests, all subdirectories that are not specified are deleted.
The call to <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Directory-manipulation.html#CDKEEP NAME=CDKEEP73> CDKEEP</A> is envisaged as follows:

<H3>Other directory related operations</H3>
<P>
As well as the commands given above for the creation and deletion of
directories there are also commands to allow manipulation of directory
partitions. (See elsewhere in this manual for description of directory
partitioning.) However such commands are outside the scope of this
tutorial and shall therefore only be mentioned in passing below.
<P>
Subroutines exist to allow the conversion of a non-partitioned directory
to a partitioned one (routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Directory-manipulation.html#CDPART NAME=CDPART74> CDPART</A>) and to allow the deletion of
specific directory partitions (routine <A HREF=H2hdbuser-Directory-manipulation.html#CDPURP NAME=CDPURP75> CDPURP</A>).
