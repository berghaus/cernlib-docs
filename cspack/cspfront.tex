\section*{Preliminary remarks}
\par This {\bf Complete Reference} of
the CSPACK system, consists of four parts:

\begin{OL}
\item An {\bf overview} of the system.
\item A {\bf step by step tutorial introduction} to the system.
\item A {\bf reference guide}, describing each command in detail.
\item An {\bf installation and management guide}.
\end{OL}

The \CSPACK{} system is implemented on various mainframes and personal
workstations. 
In particular, versions exist for IBM~VM/CMS,
VAX/VMS and various Unix-like platforms, such as Apollo, Cray,
DECstation~3100, Hewlett-Packard, IBM RS6000, Silicon Graphics, MIPs and SUN.
