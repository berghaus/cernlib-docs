<H1><A NAME=SECTION0090000000000000000> Using SHIFT Software</A></H1>
<P>
This chapter is intended as a tutorial introduction to
the SHIFT software. A separate
<em>SHIFT Reference manual</em>
is also available which describe SHIFT commands and the C and FORTRAN
interfaces to SHIFT in more detail.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0091000000000000000> Disk Pools and Files</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME=secpools><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A>
<P>
A <b>disk pool</b> is a set of Unix file systems on one or more
<i>shift</i> disk servers. Each of these file systems is mounted by NFS on every
<i>shift</i> server, using a convention for the names of the mount points which
 ensures that
files may be referred to by the same Unix
pathname on all cpu, disk and tape servers
in the <i>shift</i> configuration. This name is referred to as the <i>nfs_pathname</i>.
<P>
The <b>sfget</b> command is used to allocate a file. This is a call to the
<i>Disk Pool Manager</i> (DPM), which selects a suitable file system within the
pool specified by the user, creates any necessary directory structure within
the file system, creates an empty file, and echoes its full <i>nfs_pathname</i>.
<P>
The <i>nfs_pathname</i> has the following form:
<P>
<b>/shift/</b><i>node</i><b>/</b><i>file_system_name</i><b>/</b><i>group</i><b>/</b><i>user</i><b>/</b><i>user_supplied_partial_pathname</i>
<P>
e.g. <b>/shift/shift1/data1/c3/les/tape23</b>
<P>
The <i>node</i> is the name of the <i>shift</i> server on which the file system
is physically located. The <i>file_system_name</i> identifies the
file system on the node (it is by convention the name of the ``special&quot; file
which identifies the file system in the /dev directory).
The <i>group</i> and <i>user</i> define the owner of the file (see the discussion
on file permissions in Section <A HREF=chapter2_9.html#secpermissions><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>). The <i>user_supplied_partial_pathname</i> is the
 name of the file as supplied
by the user in the sfget command. It may be a single term (e.g. tape23),
or it may include directories (e.g. period21/run7/file26). In the latter
case the system will create the directories if necessary. Thus, the <i>nfs_pathname</i> 
returned by:
<P>
<b>sfget -p opaldst period21/run7/file26</b>
<P>
might have the form:
<P>
<b>/shift/shd01/data3/c3/les/period21/run7/file26</b>
<P>
This name may be used by the user in subsequent commands, such as
<i>tpread</i> or a call to a FORTRAN program. The user does not need to
remember the full pathname between sessions, as a
subsequent sfget call using the same <i>user_supplied_partial_pathname</i>
will locate the file and return the full pathname again.
The sfget command also sets the Unix command status to indicate if the file was
created (the status is set to a value of 1) or simply located (value 0). This
may be useful in shell scripts (the status of the last Unix command may be
tested through the $?[Bourne shell] or $status[C shell] variables).
<P>
If the user only wishes to locate the file if it is present, but not to
create it, he may use the <b>-k</b> option of sfget.
<P>
<b>sfget -p opaldst -k period21/run8/file41</b>
<P>
This example will return a status of 0, and echo the <i>nfs_pathname</i> if the file exists
in the specified pool, but merely return a status of 1 if it does not exist.
<P>
A user may list all of his files in a particular pool by means of the <b>sfsh</b>
command.
<P>
e.g. <b>sfsh -p opaldst ls period21/run7</b>
<P>
sfsh effectively performs a <i>cd</i> (change working directory) to the user's
 directory
in each of the file systems in the pool in turn, issuing the <i>ls</i> command
in each of these directories. The sfsh command is actually much more general,
 and will
issue any command specified by the user in each of the file systems in the
pool. Be careful, however, as the shell expands some characters in the command
 line
using the working directory at the time the sfsh command is issued. Thus, if it
 is wished
to issue the command <i>ls *</i> it is necessary to protect the
* from expansion by the shell by enclosing it in single quotes as follows:
<P>
<b>sfsh -p opaldst 'ls *'</b>
<P>
Files are removed from <i>shift</i> pools by means of the <b>sfrm</b> command.
<P>
e.g. <b>sfrm -p opaldst period21/run7/file26</b>
<P>
In addition to the <b>-p</b> option, specifying the disk pool to be used, all of
 the
DPM commands support the <b>-u</b> option, which allows the
caller to specify the user (and implied group) associated with the file. The
 default
is the user who issues the command.
<P>
Here is some more information about disk pools.
<P>
<UL><LI> A file system belongs to at most one disk pool.
<LI> A pool can be <i>temporary</i> or <i>permanent</i>.
If a pool is temporary, a garbage collector is run periodically
to maintain the amount of free space on each of the component
file systems above a specified <i>free space threshold</i>. This involves
deleting files on the basis of size and time of last access.
Files are deleted from permanent pools only
on explicit request by a user.
<LI> A pool can be <i>public</i> or <i>private</i>. If it is private only a
 defined set of
users
will be able to allocate space within the pool.
<LI> When a file is created by sfget the user specifies the pool which
should be used. If no pool is specified a default pool named <i>public</i> will
 be used.
The disk pool management system selects a suitable file system within the pool
 using
criteria like occupancy level, performance characteristics, etc.
<LI> The user may supply an estimate
of the size of the file which will be created (<b>-s</b> option of the sfget
 command),
to ensure that a
file system with sufficient free space is selected. The default is
200 MBytes, and so
there must be at least this amount of free space in one of the file systems
in the pool. If <i>-s 0</i> is specified this check will be omitted.
</UL><H1><A NAME=SECTION0092000000000000000> Using shift Files with FORTRAN Programs</A></H1>
<P>
Once a file has been created or located by the the Disk Pool Manager,
and the user knows the full pathname (the <i><i>nfs_pathname</i></i>), the file may be used
exactly like any other file.
Normally, however, the <i>shift</i> Remote File I/O System (RFIO) will be used to
access these files, in order to obtain the best possible performance.
The RFIO routines are used by the ZEBRA and FATMEN packages. In order to
 connect
a file to the RFIO routines, the <b>assign</b> command
must be used. Assign sets up a connection for both the RFIO routines and
for FORTRAN. The above example becomes:
<P>
<b>assign `sfget sample45` 10<BR>gendata</b>
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0093000000000000000> File Permissions and Authorisation</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME=secpermissions><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A>
<P>
This section sounds rather complicated. If you do not wish to be concerned with
the details, skip to the summary.
<P>
There are two distinct access control facilities:
<UL><LI> The right of a user to
allocate space in a disk pool. This is specified in
a configuration file used by the DPM.
The DPM will create files on behalf of a user only if
he is authorised for the particular pool.
<LI> Unix File Permissions. These are checked by the Unix file system software
whenever a file is accessed (create, read, write, remove). The DPM 
will set permissions in directories and files which it creates, as described
 later in
the present section. The user may change these permissions using normal
Unix functions. Access to a file depends on the permissions set at the time of
access, according to the usual Unix rules.
</UL>When the DPM creates directories and files, it performs checks and sets
 ownership
and permissions as follows. The <i>client</i> is the user who issues the command.
<DL ><DT>group directory
<DD>  <BR>Checks: The client must belong to the group defined by the name of the
 directory.<BR>Owner: gid of the group name, uid of root.<BR>Permissions: rwxr_xr_x<DT>user directory
<DD>  <BR>Checks: gid of the client must match that of the parent (group) directory,
and the name of the directory must correspond to a username in that group.<BR>Owner: gid of the parent directory, uid of the user defined by the name of the
 directory.<BR>Permissions: rwxr_xr_x.
<DT>lower level directories
<DD>  <BR>Checks: gid of the client must match that of the parent directory.<BR>Owner: gid and uid of the parent directory.<BR>Permissions: rwxr_xr_x.<BR><DT>the file
<DD>  <BR>Checks: gid of the client must match that of the parent directory.<BR>Owner: gid of the parent directory, uid of the client.<BR>Permissions: rwxrwxrwx minus the current user mask of the client.
<P>
 </DL><b>Summary:</b>
<P>
All files are world <b>visible</b>: anyone may read any of the
directories.
<P>
To create a file, a client must belong to the <i>group</i> in whose sub-tree the
 file
will be created. He may, however, create a file in a directory
which belongs to another <i>user</i> in that group. This allows several users
in the same group, working on a common topic, to maintain their files in
a single directory.
<P>
The client's <i>umask</i> defines access to the file itself, and so
read and write access to the file may be restricted.
<P>
The user whose name is associated with
the user-level directory owns all inferior directories, and he alone is able to
 manipulate
the directory structure manually. All other people may manipulate it only
 through DPM 
commands.
<P>
Before removing a file, the DPM checks that the
client has write permission to the file <b>or</b>
is the owner of the parent
directory <b>or</b> is the garbage collector. When a file
or directory is removed, its parent directory is also
removed if it is now empty and is below the user directory level.
No permission checks are made when directories are removed, as this is
seen as a system function, rather than being performed on behalf of the
client. The directories will be recreated automatically when required.
<P>
<b>Example</b>
<P>
Let us assume that the client is user <i>les</i> in group <i>c3</i>. There is
 another
user in group <i>c3</i> called <i>pubc3</i> (probably this is a ``dummy&quot; user
 which has been
created specifically
to own files which are common to the group). The user mask is set to 22, which
 means that
files will be created with permissions: rwxr_xr_x.

<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0094000000000000000> Tape-Disk Copying</A></H1>
<P>
The <i>shift</i> system provides two commands to copy data between tape and disk:
<b>tpread</b> (tape to disk) and <b>tpwrite</b> (disk to tape). These commands
select a <i>shift</i> tape server which has a device of the correct type available,
and initiate a process on the server to mount the tape and perform the copy
 operation.
The remote process uses the basic <i>shift</i> tape copy commands, <i>cptpdsk</i>
and <i>cpdsktp</i>.Normally the user
will not invoke these commands directly himself.
<P>
When using the tpread or tpwrite commands, the user must specify the
tape vsn or vid and the pathname of the file. The type of tape unit and its
location are specified by means of the <b>-g device_group_name</b>
option. By default this is <i>CART</i> meaning an IBM 3480-compatible
tape unit in the manually-operated section of the CERN Computer Centre
tape vault. A tape in the CERN cartridge tape robot would be
selected by <i>-g SMCF</i>.
<P>
The following example copies data from tape into a file in a <i>shift</i> disk pool.
First we obtain the pathname of the file from sfget. The example assumes that we
are using the C shell, and first stores the pathname allocated by sfget in a
shell variable called NFSNAME.
This variable is then used in the subsequent
tpread, which copies the first file from a cartridge tape into the disk file.
<P>
<b>set NFSNAME=`sfget -p opaldst testtape`<BR>tpread -v xu4125 $NFSNAME</b>
<P>
This could of course be achieved by the single command:
<P>
<b>tpread -v xu4125 `sfget -p opaldst testtape`</b>
<P>
Similarly, data can be copied from disk to tape using the sequence:
<P>
<b>set NFSNAME=`sfget -p opaldst testtape`<BR>tpwrite -v fz7425 -q 1 $NFSNAME</b>
<P>
The next example demonstrates how to copy the first four files
from a tape into a single disk file (in this case in the PUBLIC pool).
<P>
<b>tpread -v qw8256 -q 1-4 `sfget testtape`</b>
<P>
The files may be copied into separate files by simply supplying
a list of pathnames.
<P>
<b>tpread -v qw8256 -q 1-4 `sfget tfile1` `sfget tfile2` `sfget
 tfile3` `sfget tfile4`</b>
<P>
Multiple files may be created on tape with a single tpwrite command in the same
 way.
<P>
<b>tpwrite -v mv1423 -q 1-4 `sfget tfile1` `sfget tfile2`
 `sfget tfile3` `sfget tfile4`</b>
<P>
There are many other parameters to the tpread and tpwrite commands,
concerned with label formats, record formats, etc.
<P>
Although the above examples all use <i>sfget</i> to generate a pathname, the
 tpread and tpwrite
commands are entirely independent of the Disk Pool Manager, and may be used to
 copy data to and
from any disk files accessible to the <i>shift</i> system.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0095000000000000000> Tape Staging</A></H1>
<P>
The idea of tape staging, with a history at CERN dating back to the CDC7600
in the early 70's, is that a file which has a permanent home on tape
is copied to disk while it is being used, the disk copy being thrown away when
 the
space is needed for new data. Similarly, a program creates a new file on disk,
 and
copies it to tape when the program has terminated correctly. The disk copy may
 then
be removed immediately, or may be left in the stage area, to be removed
 automatically
by a garbage collector.
<P>
<i>shift</i> will not support a general tape staging mechanism, but it includes a
 number of features
which can be used to build such facilities, and a simple stage script is
 provided -
See <em>SHIFT Reference Manual.</em>
This may be used as an example for more complicated
stage routines tailored to the user's needs.  The source of the script is
 maintained in the library
<b>/usr/local/bin</b>. It is basically a one-line interface to <i>sfget</i>, <i>tpread/tpwrite</i>
and <i>assign</i>. When used in conjunction with a <i>shift</i> <i>temporary</i> disk
 pool it provides
a straight-forward staging facility.
<P>
There are two stage commands: <b>stagein</b>, which checks to see if the file is
 already present on
disk and copies it in from tape if necessary, and <b>stageout</b> which copies a
 file from disk to
tape. Both of these commands are implemented by a single shell script, <i>stage</i>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0095100000000000000> stagein</A></H2>
<P>
<UL><LI> issues an <i>sfget</i> to locate or create the file;
<LI> if the file was created, issues a <i>tpread</i> to copy the
data from tape to disk;
<LI> if requested by the user (-U option) issues an <i>assign</i> command
to connect the file to a FORTRAN unit number.
</UL><H2><A NAME=SECTION0095200000000000000> stageout</A></H2>
<P>
<UL><LI> issues an <i>sfget</i> to locate the file to be staged out;
<LI> issues a <i>tpwrite</i> to copy the file to tape;
</UL>The parameters of both stagein and stageout are those of the
sfget, tpread and tpwrite commands, with the restriction that multiple
disk files are not supported.
<P>
<b>Examples</b>
<P>
<OL><LI> <b>stagein -v ux3456 -g SMCF -q 4 -U 11 testfile.4</b>
<P>
will stage in file 4 from a tape in the CERN cartridge robot,
to the PUBLIC disk pool and assign
the disk file to FORTRAN unit 11.
<P>
<LI> <b>stageout -v uz1654 -g SMCF -q 6 -p opaldst run26</b>
<P>
locates the file <i>run26</i> in the pool <i>opaldst</i> and copies it to tape.
<P>
<LI> <b>stagein -v rm3458 -g CART -q 3- batch6.ntuples</b>
<P>
will stage tape data from file 3 to the end of the tape into a single disk file.
<P>
<LI> Notice that <i>stageout</i> copies the file immediately.
If a job creates a file
and wishes to copy it to tape at the end, it is probably more appropriate to use
 the
<i>sfget</i>, <i>assign</i> and <i>tpwrite</i> commands directly.
<P>
<b>....<BR>....<BR>OUTFILE=`sfget tempfile`<BR>assign $OUTFILE10</b><BR><i>( get a file in the public pool, and assign it to FORTRAN unit 10)</i><BR><b>....<BR>....<BR>simul</b>  <i>( run the program, which writes to unit 10)</i><BR><b>....<BR>....<BR>tpwrite -v wg7634 -g CART $OUTFILE<BR>sfrm $OUTFILE</b><BR><i>(write out the file, and remove the disk copy)</i>
