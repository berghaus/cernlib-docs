<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0041000000000000000> OPAL CPU and File Servers</A></H1>
<P>
The CPU power for OPAL within SHIFT is provided by four
<em>Silicon Graphics</em>
Power Series systems, each with system has 4 MIPS3000
processors rated at 33 MHz.
The systems have 64 MBytes of memory, an ethernet interface,
and a Power channel which provides 2 single ended SCSI channels.
Additional differential SCSI channels are provided by Interphase
<em>Jaguar</em> boards which connect via the VME card cage in the
SGI systems.
A VME interface board is also used to connect to Ultranet.
<P>
The OPAL systems are named SHIFT1, SHIFT2, SHIFT3 with a total
CPU capacity of 72 CERN units. In addition, the SHD01 system
which is owned by CN division and used as a combined file/CPU server
provides a further 24 CERN units.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0042000000000000000> ALEPH CPU and File Server</A></H1>
<P>
The ALEPH collaboration use a single
<em>Silicon Graphics</em>
Power Series system with 4 MIPS3000
processors rated at 40 MHz.
The system has 64 MBytes of memory, an ethernet interface,
and a Power channel which provides 2 single ended SCSI channels.
Additional differential SCSI channels are provided by Interphase
em Jaguar boards which connect via the VME card cage in the
SGI systems.
A VME interface board is also used to connect to Ultranet.
<P>
The ALEPH system is named SHIFT6
and delivers a CPU capacity of 32 CERN units.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0043000000000000000> SMC CPU Servers</A></H1>
<P>
The Spin-Muon Collaboration use two SUN systems: a twin
processor SUN630 and a SPARCstation-10.
Both systems are networked to ethernet and SHIFT4 is
connected to UltraNet.
The SUN systems are named SHIFT4 and SHIFT5
and deliver a CPU capacity of 18 CERN units.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0044000000000000000> SHIFT Fileservers</A></H1>
<P>
Two
<em>Silicon Graphics</em>
CRIMSON systems are used solely as file servers.
These are single processor MIPS4000 systems rated at 50 MHz
which can support up to to six differential SCSI channels in addition
to an UltraNet VME board.
<P>
The SHIFT filebase is distributed across the
<em>Silicon Graphics</em>
systems and is made up of SEAGATE WREN disks.
Most are either WREN-7 of 1.1 MB capacity or WREN-8 of 1.5 MB capacity.
Recently, WREN-9 units have been purchased with a formatted capacity of 1.8 MB.
The disks are rack mounted as much as possible and connected
to the system units via Differential SCSI interface boards,
each interface providing two SCSI channels.
The differential interfaces allow the disk trays to be located
up to 20m from the Power Series systems which facilitates
the organisation of the equipment within the computer center.
The disks are grouped in trays of either four or six disks and each
tray is built as a UNIX logical volume with an associated filesystem.
<P>
A detailed description of the current SHIFT configuration is maintained
in the document
<em>Systems Administration for CORE.</em>
Copies of this document are available on request from Gordon Lee in CN division.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0045000000000000000> Backbone Network - UltraNet</A></H1>
<P>
<b>UltraNet</b>
is a special purpose network running over co-axial cable or optical fiber.
Machines are connected to a central hub and hubs can be interconnected
to form a star topology.
For the SHIFT systems, the UltraNet connection is via a VME interface board.
<P>
The TCP/IP protocols are supported by Ultra and by performing a high
level of protocol processing on the PP's, the CPU consumption
for high data rate transfers is kept to a minimum.
<b>UltraNet</b>
is designed to be effective for
<em>stream-type</em>
transfers and this maps well on to High Energy Physics
applications where accesses are sequential and use large record lengths.
The coaxial cables used in UltraNet can support data transfer rates of
256 Mbit/second.
In the SHIFT environment, the average data transfer rate is
between 4 and 8 MBytes/second.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0046000000000000000> CORE Infrastructure - Tape Servers and Home Directories</A></H1>
<P>
The SHIFT tape staging facilities form an important part of both
SHIFT and CSF giving access to IBM 3480 and Exabyte cartridges.
The 3480 cartridge media offers high data transfer rates, up to 2 MBytes/second
and excellent levels of data integrity.
The 3480 cartridges have a capacity of 200 MBytes but the high density
versions, 3490 can hold up to 800 MBytes of data.
Exabyte cartridges are also used at CERN but to a smaller extent.
These have a capacity of either 2 or 5 Gigabytes but with a data transfer rate
substantially lower than that of the 3480 cartridge.
<P>
The 3480 and Exabyte units are located in the
CERN tape vault and are connected to SUN-4/330 systems. The connection
is made a SCSI extension product making use of single-ended to
differential SCSI converter boards.
3480 cartridges held in the central IBM robot are accessed
via tape units connected to the CRAY UNICOS system.
The SHIFT tape facilities currently stage a total of about 1500 tapes per week,
with about half being mounted automatically through the IBM robot.
