\Shubr{GLAST}{}
Standard {\tt GEANT} termination routine:
\begin{itemize}
\item computes and prints the processing time per event;
\item calls \Rind{MZEND} to print the statistics relative to the current run;
\item if the structure {\tt JGSTAT} has been initialised, calls \Rind{GPSTAT}
{\tt [GEOM700]}.
\end{itemize}
