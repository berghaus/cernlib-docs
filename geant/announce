         UPDATED VERSION OF THE GEANT MANUAL.
         ====================================

As promised at the last GEANT User's Meeting, we want 
to announce that the updated version of the GEANT manual
(corresponding to release 3.21) is now available as a 
PostScript file on the CERN asis01 file server where it 
can be accessed via anonymous ftp and is located in the
directory cernlib/doc/geant

The complete manual (451 pages) has the name geantall.ps,
while the various sections (e.g., DRAW, PHYS, XINT)
are also available separately in the same directory. 
The latter might be interesting when you encounter problems 
while printing the complete manual.

Please send your comments, suggestions and bug
reports to Sven Ravndal (ravndal@cern.ch)
