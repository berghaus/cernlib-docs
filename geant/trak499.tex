{\tt JX=LQ(JXYZ-ITRA)} is the pointer to the space points of track number 
{\tt ITRA}
 
The space point banks {\tt JXYZ} are only used for debug and display
purposes. They can be filled by using the routine \Rind{GSXYZ} from
\Rind{GUSTEP}. The drawing routine \Rind{GDXYZ}
gets the space coordinates from {\tt JXYZ}.
