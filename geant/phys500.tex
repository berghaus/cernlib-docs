\Ssubr{CALL GPHADR}
Called at each step in order to compute the remaining distance to the
hadronic interaction point (see PHYS 010, formula 4).
The mean free path $\lambda$ is re evaluated at each step:
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{1}{\Sigma} = \frac{A}{N \rho \sigma (Z,E)}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{DL}{MMM}
\item[$N$]     Avogadro's number
\item[$Z,A$]   atomic number and weight of the medium
\item[$\rho$]   density of the medium
\item[$\sigma$] total cross section per atom for hadronic interaction, computed
by the function \Rind{GPHSIGM} below.
\end{DL}
\Ssubr{FUNCTION GHSIGM (P,IPART,A)}
Returns absorption cross section in millibarns for a particle with
momentum $P$ (GeV/$c$).
 
GEANT type {\tt IPART} on a hadron of atomic number A.
 
The cross section table has been provided by R. Barlow (Manchester), January 198
\Ssubr{GALL GHTATI }
The interface routine with the T. Baroncelli routines of {\tt  TATINA}.
Generate the finale particle's state after an hadronic interaction.
