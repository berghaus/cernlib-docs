\Makehead{ZEBRA sequential files handling}

\Shubr{GOPEN}{(LUN,CHOPT,LEN,IER*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[LUN] ({\tt INTEGER}) logical unit number, 1$\leq${\tt LUN}$<$100;
\item[CHOPT] ({\tt CHARACTER*(*)}) any valid combination of
\Rind{FZFILE} options (see~\cite{bib-ZEBRAFZ,bib-ZEBRA}), the most common
being:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[I] input file;
\item[O] output file;
\item[X] exchange mode file;
\end{DLtt}
\item[LEN] ({\tt INTEGER}) maximum record length,
for more details see routine {\tt FZFILE} in the {\tt ZEBRA} manual;
\item[IER] ({\tt INTEGER}) error flag:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[0] legal open request;
\item[1] attempt to open more than 5 {\tt ZEBRA} sequential files;
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}
Opens a {\tt ZEBRA} {\tt FZ} file for sequential I/O of {\tt GEANT}
data structures. No more than 5 files can be open at any one time.

\Shubr{GCLOSE}{(LUN,IER*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[LUN] ({\tt INTEGER}) logical unit to be closed, if 0 all {\tt ZEBRA}
{\tt FZ} streams will be closed;
\item[IER] ({\tt INTEGER}) error flag:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[0] legal close request;
\item[1] no unit was found open;
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}
This routine closes one or all {\tt ZEBRA} {\tt FZ} file(s). This is a 
mandatory routines for all open {\tt ZEBRA} files before the end of the
program. Failure to call this routine may cause files to be incompletely
written to the storage media.
