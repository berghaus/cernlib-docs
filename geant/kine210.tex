\Makehead{$\tau^{\pm}$ generation and decay}

\Shubr{GALL GTAU}{}
This routine is now dummy and it will only print an error message.
The appropriate routines from a generator Monte Carlo (for instance 
the {\tt JETSET}~\cite{bib-JETS} package)
should be used to handle $\tau^{\pm}$ production and decay.
