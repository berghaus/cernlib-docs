       CALL  GPRELA



GPRELA  adds  to  the  muon  energy  loss  tables  the
contribution  due  to  mu    -nucleus  interactions  and
e+e--pair  production  in  which  the  energy  of  the
pair  is  below  threshold  (see  later).  For  the
contribution  of  pair  production,  it  calls  the
function  GPRELM.  The  energy  binning  is  in  the
array  ELOW  (common  /CGMULO/).  The  following
pointers  are  used:



                                                                              th
JMA  =  LQ(JMATE-I)                                        pointer  to  the  I

                                                                 +        -

GPRELA  is  called  during  initialisation  by  GPHYSI.



       VALUE    =    GPRELM                            (Z,T,CUT)



Z                         (REAL)  atomic  number  of  the  material;
T                         (REAL)  kinetic  energy  of  the  muon;
CUT                       (REAL)  maximum  energy  for  the  pair
                          considered  by  the  routine.


GPRELM  calculates  the  energy  loss  due  to  the
direct  production  by  muons  of  e-e+pairs  with



energy  below  CUT  (PPCUTM  in  common  /GCCUTS/).
Above  this  cut,  the  direct  pairs  are  produced  as
discrete  processes  (see  [PHYS451]).  GPRELM  is
called  by  GPRELA.



       CALL  GPRSGA



GPRSGA  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for  the
pair  production  by  photons  and  the  direct  pair
production  by  muons.  It  tabulates  the  mean  free
path  in  cm  as  a  function  of  medium  and  energy.  For
the  direct  pair  production  of  muons,  it  calls  the
function  GPRSGM.  The  energy  binning  is  in  the
array  ELOW  (common  /CGMULO/).  The  following
pointers  are  used:



                                                                              th
JMA  =  LQ(JMATE-I)                                        pointer  to  the  I

JPAIR  =  LQ(JMA-10)                                       pointer  to  photon  pair
                                                           production  cross-sections;
JPAIR+NEK1                                                 pointer  to  muon  pair
                                                           production.


GPRSGA  is  called  during  initialisation  by  GPHYSI.



       VALUE    =    GPRSGM                            (Z,T,CUT)



Z                         (REAL)  atomic  number  of  the  medium;
T                         (REAL)  kinetic  energy  of  the  muon;
CUT                       (REAL)  minimum  energy  for  the  e-e+pair.


GPRSGM  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for
muon  direct  pair  production  where  the  energy  of
the  pair  is  greater  than  CUT  (PPCUTM  in  common
/GCCUTS/).  It  is  called  by  GPRSGA  (see
[PHYS451]).
