 <H2>  Introduction  </H2>


 <PRE>


 GEANT  uses  the  FFREAD    package  to  read  free  format
 data  records  in  the  routine  GFFGO.  The  keywords
 accepted  by  GFFGO  can  be  classified  as:


1.      general  control  of  the  run;
2.      control  of  the  physics  processes;
3.      debug  and  I/O  operations;
4.      user  applications;
5.      Lund  event  generation.


 The  data  records  are  listed  below  by  category
 with  the  following  information:


 KEY           keyword,  any  number  of  characters  truncated
               to  the  first  4  unless  otherwise  specified  by
               the  user;
 N             maximum  expected  number  of  variables
               (NVAR);
 T             type  of  these  variables  (I=INTEGER,  R=REAL
               or  M=MIXED)  and  for  each  variable  in  turn:

                           *  variable  FORTRAN  name;
                           *  short  description  (more  detail  in
                              [ZZZZ010]);
                           *  labelled  common  where  it  is  stored;
                           *  default  value,  usually  from  GINIT.


 When  a  record  is  decoded,  the  values  entered  by
 the  user  in  free  format  are  assigned  to  the
 variables  in  order.  The  number  of  values  can  be
 less  than  NVAR.  In  case  of  a  MIXED  type  the  values
 entered  have  agree  with  the  type  of  the
 corresponding  variable.


 For  example  the  data  record:
            RUNG      5      201


 presets  the  run  and  event  number  to  5  and  201



respectively.  None  of  the  records  mentioned  below
is  mandatory.


</PRE>


<H2>  User  defined  data  records  </H2>


<PRE>


Before  calling  GFFGO  the  user  may  define  private
data  records  through  calls  to  FFKEY  as  follows:
         CALL  FFKEY('key',VAR(1),NVAR,'type')


They  will  be  interpreted  by  GFFGO  in  the  same  way
as  the  GEANT  pre-defined  records.

Note:  the  time  allowed  for  the  job  after
initialisation  cannot  be  set  by  the  user  via  the
data  record.  To  set  the  total  time  for  the  job  the
user  should  call  the  TIMEST  routine  at  the
beginning  of  the  program  before  any  call  to  GEANT
routines.  This  variable  in  the  data  record  has
not  been  removed  for  backward  compatibility.

Note:  the  user  data  records  for  I/O  have  no  effect
on  the  GEANT  system,  and  the  user  is  supposed  to
analyse  them  at  run  time  and  take  corresponding
action.  For  instance,  a  use  of  the  PRIN  data

<H3>Scan  geometry  control</H3>


<PRE>


The  scan  geometry  has  been  introduced  in  GEANT
version  3.15  with  the  idea  of  developing  a
general  parametrisation  scheme.  While  the  scan
geometry  can  already  be  built,  the
parametrisation  scheme  has  not  yet  been
developed,  so  the  following  data  records  have  to
be  considered  as  a  forward  compatibility  feature.

<H3>Landau  fluctuations  versus  delta         -rays</H3>


<PRE>


In  order  to  avoid  double  counting  between  energy
loss  fluctuations  (ILOSS=2)  and  generation  of
delta         -rays  IDRAY=1,  if  ILOSS  =  2  the  default
value  for  delta         -ray  generation  is  set  to  0  and  it
cannot  be  changed.  The  different  cases  are
summarised  in  the  table  below.
