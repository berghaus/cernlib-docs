</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Introduction  to  the  manual</H2>


<PRE>    The  present  documentation  is  divided  into
sections  which  follow  the  structure  of  GEANT  and
its  major  functions.  Each  section  is  identified
by  a  keyword  which  indicates  its  content.
Sections  are  in  alphabetical  order:


AAAA                      introduction  to  the  system;
BASE                      GEANT  framework  and  user  interfaces  to
                          be  read  first;
CONS                      particles,  materials  and  tracking
                          medium  parameters;
DRAW                      the  drawing  package,  interfaced  to
                          HIGZ;
GEOM                      the  geometry  package;
HITS                      the  detector  response  package;
IOPA                      the  I/O  package;
KINE                      event  generators  and  kinematic
                          structures;
PHYS                      physics  processes;
TRAK                      the  tracking  package;
XINT                      interactive  user  interface;
ZZZZ                      appendix.


Within  each  section,  the  principal  system
functions  or  the  details  of  subroutines  are
described  in  a  series  of  papers  numbered  from  001
to  999.  In  the  upper  left  corner  it  is  indicated
in  which  Geant  release  the  subroutines  were
introduced  and  left  unchanged.  The  authors  of  the
conceptual  ideas  or/and  of  the  early  versions  of
the  code  are  acknowledged  under  the  item  Origin,
while  Revision  contains  the  contributors  to  any
important  upgrade.  Documentation  is  essential,
but  sometime  implies  a  not  negligeable  amount  of
work.  When  relevant  these  contributions  are
acknowledged  here.  In  addition  all  reported  bugs,
accepted  suggestions...etc...are  mentioned  in
the  history  part  of  the  source  code  and
correction  cradle.


Subroutines  which  are  not  necessary  for  an
understanding  of  the  program  flow  and  which  are
not  intended  to  be  called  directly  by  the  user
have  been  omitted.



The  notation  [<KEYW>nnn]  is  used  whenever
additional  information  can  be  found  in  the  quoted
section.  In  the  description  of  subroutine  calling
sequences,  the  arguments  used  both  on  input  and
on  output  are  preceded  by  a  *  and  the  output
arguments  are  followed  by  a  *  .


For  convenience,  two  more  sections  have  been
added:  the  section  AAAA,  for  general  introductory
information  at  the  beginning,  and  the  section
ZZZZ,  for  various  appendices  and  indexed  lists,
at  the  end.


A  table  of  contents  is  available  in  AAAA000.  To
ease  access  to  this  documentation  an  index
appears  in  ZZZZ999.  It  gives  in  alphabetic  order
the  names  of  all  documented  GEANT  subroutines
with  references  to  the  appropriate  write  up(s).


A  short  write  up  of  GEANT  can  be  obtained  by
collecting  the  papers  numbered  001  to  009  in  each
section.
