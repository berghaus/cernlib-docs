       CALL  GBREMM



GBREMM  generates  a  photon  from  bremsstrahlung  of
a  highly  energetic  muon  as  a  discrete  process.
For  the  angular  distribution  of  the  photon,  is
calls  the  function  GBTETH.


Input:                    via  common  /GCTRAK/;
Output:                   via  common  /GCKING/.


GBREMM  is  called  from  the  tracking  routine  GTMUON
when  the  muon  reaches  its  radiation  point  during
the  tracking  stage  of  GEANT.



       VALUE    =    GBTETH                            (ENER,PARTM,EFRAC)



ENER                      (REAL)  kinetic  energy  of  the  muon;
PARTM                     (REAL)  mass  of  the  radiating  particle
                          (m        in  this  case);
                            mu

EFRAC                     (REAL)  ratio  of  the  energy  of  the
                          radiated  photon  to  the  energy  of  the
                          muon.


GBTETH  calculates  the  angular  distribution  of  the
e-e+pair  in  photon  pair  production  and  of  the
photon  in  bremsstrahlung.  In  case  of
bremsstrahlung  it  gives  the  scaled  angle

                            -1
(eta      = Etheta         m      )  of  the  photon.

of  a  photon  of  energy  k  by  a  muon  of  energy  E  is  :

                                                                                  p  ===                 1/3

Therefore,  the  differential  cross-section  can  be
written  as


                                ((dsigma         )/ (dv)) = f(v)g(v)                                                        (2)


with


                                                              -1
f(v)               =         [v ln   (((v         )/ (v   )))]
                                         max           c



                                                                     2
g(v)               =         ((1)/ (Phi      (0)))(1- v + ((3)/ (4))v   )Phi      (delta         )


We  can  sample  the  photon  energy  in  the  following
way  (r   ,  r     uniformly  distributed  random  numbers
       1      2

in  ]0, 1[):



1.      sample  v:

                                                                        r
                                        v = v   (((v         )/ (v   ))) 1
                                             c      max           c


2.      compute  the  rejection  function  g(v)  and:
            (a)        if  r   >g(v)  go  back  to  step  1
                            2

            (b)        if  r   < =    g(v),  accept  v  and  k = vE.
                            2


 After  the  successful  sampling  of  k,  GBREMM
 generates  the  polar  angles  of  the  radiated  photon
 with  respect  to  an  axis  defined  along  the  parent
 muon's  momentum  calling  GBTETH.  For  more
 information  on  the  sampling  procedure  see
 [PHYS341].
