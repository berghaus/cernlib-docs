       CALL  GPHOT                       GPHOT



simulates  the  photoelectric  effect.  It  uses  the
following  input  and  output:


Input                  via  common  GCTRAK
Output                 via  common  GCKING


It  calls  the  functions  GPHSG1,  GPHSGP,  GAVRL2  and
GAVRL3  for  the  cross-section  and  the  functions
GHPHAK,  GHPHAL1,  GHPHAL2,  GPHAL3  for  the  cosine
distribution  of  the  photoelectron.  GPHOT  is
called  by  the  tracking  routine  GTGAMA,  if,  and
when,  the  photon  reaches  its  interaction  point.



       VALUE    =    GAVRL2                            (GAMAL2,BETAL2,X)



GAVRL2  calculates  approximation  of  the
cross-section  for  the  photoelectric  effect  from
L        shell.  GAMAL2,  BETAL2  are  the  Lorentz  gamma
 II

and  beta  factors  of  the  emitted  photoelectron  and
X = m   / E                where  m     is  the  electron  mass  and
     e     gamma                   e

       VALUE    =    GAVRL3                            (GAMAL3,BETAL3,X)



GAVRL3  calculates  approximation  of  the
cross-section  for  the  photoelectric  effect  from
L           shell.  GAMAL3,  BETAL3  are  the  Lorentz  gamma
 III

and  beta  factors  of  the  emitted  photoelectron  and
X = m   / E                where  m     is  the  electron  mass  and
     e     gamma                   e

E                is  the  incident  radiation  energy.  GAVRL3
 gamma

is  called  by  GPHOT.



       VALUE    =    GPHAK                          (BETAK)



       VALUE    =    GPHAL1                            (BETAL1)



GPHAK  and  its  entry  point  GPHAL1  poll  the  cosine
distribution  (w.r.t.  the  incident  photon
direction)  of  the  photoelectron  emitted  from  K  or
L     shell,  respectively.  They  are  called  by  GPHOT.

       VALUE    =    GPHAL2                            (BETAL2)



GPHAL2  polls  the  cosine  distribution  (w.r.t.  the
incident  photon  direction)  of  the  photoelectron
emitted  from  L        shell.
                II



       VALUE    =    GPHAL3                            (BETAL3)



GPHAL3  polls  the  cosine  distribution  (w.r.t.  the
incident  photon  direction)  of  the  photoelectron
emitted  from  L           shell.  It  is  called  by  GPHOT.

       VALUE    =    GPHSGP                            (EGAM)



GPHSGP  calculates  the  photoelectric  effect  total
cross-section  for  a  particular  atom  of  a  mixture



taking  into  account  weights.  It  is  called  by
GPHOT  for  Z< =    100.

If  the  energy  of  the  radiation  incident  on  an  atom
is  E               ,  then  the  quanta  can  be  absorbed  if
     gamma

E               >E               .  The  photoelectron  is  emitted  with
 gamma            shell

total  energy:


                   E                                      = E               - E               + m   .                       (1)

In  the  above  equation  it  is  assumed  that  the  atom
has  infinite  mass.  One  should  note  that  there
exists  a  correction  term  (see    and  references
therein)  which  becomes  more  and  more  important
with  increasing  E                    .

<H3>Probability  of  Interaction  with  an  Atom</H3>


<PRE>


Probability  of  the  interaction  with  an  atom  is
calculated  taking  into  account  partial
cross-sections  of  atoms  of  a  mixture  or  a
compound.

<H3>Probability  of  Interaction  with  a  Shell</H3>


<PRE>


To  calculate  the  probability  of  the  interaction
with  a  particular  shell  we  use  the  jump  ratios
defined  as:


J               = ((sigma         (E               +delta         E))/ (sigma         (E               - delta         E)))
 shell                              shell                                               shell

                                                                                                                            (2)
where  delta         E- >   0.  In  addition  we  assume  that  the
jump  ratio  is  also  valid  away  from  the  edges.
From  (??    )  it  follows  that  the  probability  p
                                                      shell



to  interact  with  a  shell  is:

                                p               = 1- ((1)/ (J               ))                                              (3)
                                 shell                       shell


We  use  the  following  parametrisation  of  the  jump
ratios  for  K  and  L     shells:

                                       J    = ((125)/ (Z)) + 3. 5                                                           (4)
                                        K


                                                       J       = 1. 2                                                       (5)

After  simple  calculations  one  obtains  the
probability  distribution  function  which  is  used
to  select  the  shell.


</PRE>


<H3>Angular  distributions  of  photoelectrons</H3>


<PRE>


The  angular  distributions  of  photoelectrons
should  be  calculated  using  the  partial  wave
analysis  for  the  outgoing  electron.  Since  this
method  is  very  time  consuming  we  use
approximations  of  the  angular  distributions
calculated  by  F.  von  Sauter      (K  shell)  and
Gavrila      (K  and  L  shells).  We  use  the
cross-section  which  is  correct  only  to  zero  order
in  alpha         Z.  This  approximation  foresees  zero
scattering  amplitude  in  the  direction  of  incident
photon  while  experimentally  the  cross-section  at
0  angle  is  non-vanishing  .  If


                                    X         =         1- beta       cos      Theta

After  the  photoelectron  emission  the  atom  is  left
in  excited  state.  The  excitation  energy  equal  to
the  binding  energy  E     of  the  shell  in  which  the
                       i

interaction  took  place.  Subsequently  the  atom
emits  a  fluorescent  photon  or  Auger  or
Coster-Kronig  electron.  The  selection  of
radiative  or  non-radiative  transition  is  based  on
compilation  by  Krause  .
The  Auger  or  Coster-Kronig  transitions  are
represented  by  the  most  probable  line  for  a  given
vacancy  .  The  emitted  electron  energy  E     is
                                             e


                                              E    = E   - (E    + E   )                                                 (11)

In  case  of  fluorescence  we  use  transition  rates
of  Scofield  .  We  use  only  those  transitions  for
which  the  occurrence  probability  is  not  less  than
1%.  The  fluorescent  photon  is  emitted  with  energy
E
 gamma

                                                E               = E   - E                                                (12)

for  transition  between  the  subshells  i  and  j.
In  addition  to  the  above,  to  fulfill  the  energy
conservation  law,  emission  of  an  additional
photon  is  simulated.  For  non-radiative
transitions  its  energy  is  E     (see  formula  ??    ).  In
                               k

case  of  fluorescent  transition  this  photon  has
energy  E     (see  equation  ??    ).  The  angular
         j

distribution  of  the  emitted  particle  is
isotropic.
