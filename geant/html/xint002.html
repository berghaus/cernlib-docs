Clipping  commands.  The  hidden  line  removal
technique  is  necessary  to  visualize  properly  very
complex  detectors.  At  the  same  time,  it  can  be
useful  to  visualize  the  inner  elements  of  a
detector  in  detail.  For  this  purpose,  the
commands  menu  CVOL  has  been  developed:  these
commands  allow  subtractions  (via  boolean
operation)  of  given  shapes  from  any  part  of  the
detector,  therefore  showing  its  inner  contents.
It  is  possible  to  clip  each  different  volume  by
means  of  a  different  shape  (BOX  ,  TUBE,  CONE,  SPHE
are  available).  If  '*'  is  given  as  the  name  of  the
volume  to  be  clipped,  all  volumes  are  clipped  by
the  given  shape.  A  volume  can  be  clipped  at  most
twice  (even  by  different  shapes);  if  a  volume  is
explicitely  clipped  twice,  the  '*'  will  not  act
on  it  anymore.  Giving  '.'  as  the  name  of  the
volume  to  be  clipped  will  reset  the  clipping.

This  command  performs  a  boolean  subtraction
between  the  volume  CNVV  and  a  box  placed  in  the
MARS  according  the  values  of  the  given
coordinates.  See  also  CVOL.  The  following
commands  will  clip  by  a  box,  with  a  vertex  at  the
origin,  the  volume  specified  by  NAME  (a  valid
string  for  the  NAME  of  the  volume  can  be  found
using  the  DTREE  command).

<H2>GEANT/DRAWING</H2>


<PRE>


Drawing  commands.  These  commands  allow  the
visualization  in  several  ways  of  the  volumes
defined  in  the  geometrical  data  structure.  It  is
possible  to  draw  the  logical  tree  of  volumes
belonging  to  the  detector  (DTREE),  to  show  their
geometrical  specification  (DSPEC,DFSPC),  to  draw
them  and  their  cut  views  (DRAW,  DCUT).  Moreover,
it  is  possible  to  execute  these  commands  when  the
hidden  line  removal  option  is  activated;  in  this
case,  the  volumes  can  be  also  either  translated
in  the  space  (SHIFT),  or  clipped  by  boolean
operation  (CVOL).  In  addition,  it  is  possible  to
fill  the  surfaces  of  the  volumes  with  solid
colours  when  the  shading  option  (SHAD)  is
activated.  Several  tools  (ZOOM,  LENS)  have  been
developed  to  zoom  detailed  parts  of  the  detectors
or  to  scan  physical  events  as  well.  Finally,  the
command  MOVE  will  allow  the  rotation,  translation
and  zooming  on  real  time  parts  of  the  detectors  or
tracks  and  hits  of  a  simulated  event.  Ray-tracing
commands.  In  case  the  command  (DOPT  RAYT  ON)  is
executed,  the  drawing  is  performed  by  the  Geant
ray-tracing;  automatically,  the  color  is
assigned  according  to  the  tracking  medium  of  each
volume  and  the  volumes  with  a  density  lower/equal
than  the  air  are  considered  transparent;  if  the
option  (USER)  is  set  (ON)  (again  via  the  command
(DOPT)),  the  user  can  set  color  and  visibility
for  the  desired  volumes  via  the  command  (SATT),
as  usual,  relatively  to  the  attributes  (COLO)  and
(SEEN).  The  resolution  can  be  set  via  the  command
(SATT  *  FILL  VALUE),  where  (VALUE)  is  the  ratio
between  the  number  of  pixels  drawn  and  20  (user
coordinates).  Parallel  view  and  perspective  view
are  possible  (DOPT  PROJ  PARA/PERS);  in  the  first
case,  we  assume  that  the  first  mother  volume  of
the  tree  is  a  box  with  dimensions  10000  X  10000  X
10000  cm  and  the  view  point  (infinetely  far)  is
5000  cm  far  from  the  origin  along  the  Z  axis  of  the
user  coordinates;  in  the  second  case,  the
distance  between  the  observer  and  the  origin  of
the  world  reference  system  is  set  in  cm  by  the
command  (PERSP  NAME  VALUE);  grand-angle  or
telescopic  effects  can  be  achieved  changing  the
scale  factors  in  the  command  (DRAW).  When  the
final  picture  does  not  occupy  the  full  window,
mapping  the  space  before  tracing  can  speed  up  the
drawing,  but  can  also  produce  less  precise
results;  values  from  1  to  4  are  allowed  in  the
command  (DOPT  MAPP  VALUE),  the  mapping  being  more



precise  for  increasing  (VALUE);  for  (VALUE  =  0)
no  mapping  is  performed  (therefore  max  precision
and  lowest  speed).  The  command  (VALCUT)  allows
the  cutting  of  the  detector  by  three  planes
ortogonal  to  the  x,y,z  axis.  The  attribute  (LSTY)
can  be  set  by  the  command  SATT  for  any  desired
volume  and  can  assume  values  from  0  to  7;  it
determines  the  different  light  processing  to  be
performed  for  different  materials:  0  =  dark-matt,
1  =  bright-matt,  2  =  plastic,  3  =  ceramic,  4  =
rough-metals,  5  =  shiny-metals,  6  =  glass,  7  =
mirror.  The  detector  is  assumed  to  be  in  the  dark,
the  ambient  light  luminosity  is  0.2  for  each
basic  hue  (the  saturation  is  0.9)  and  the
observer  is  assumed  to  have  a  light  source
(therefore  he  will  produce  parallel  light  in  the
case  of  parallel  view  and  point-like-source  light
in  the  case  of  perspective  view).

       CALL  GDRAW(name,theta,phi,psi,u0,v0,su,sv)


If  optional  parameters  are  missing,  the
corresponding  values  are  taken  from  the  common
/GCDRAW/.  This  command  will  draw  the  volumes,
selected  with  their  graphical  attributes,  set  by
the  SATT  facility.  The  drawing  may  be  performed
with  hidden  line  removal  and  with  shading  effects



according  to  the  value  of  the  options  HIDE  and
SHAD;  if  the  option  SHAD  is  ON,  the  contour's
edges  can  be  drawn  or  not.  If  the  option  HIDE  is
ON,  the  detector  can  be  exploded  (BOMB),  clipped
with  different  shapes  (CVOL),  and  some  of  its
parts  can  be  shifted  from  their  original  position
(SHIFT).  When  HIDE  is  ON,  if  the  drawing  requires
more  than  the  available  memory,  the  program  will
evaluate  and  display  the  number  of  missing  words
(so  that  the  user  can  increase  the  size  of  its
ZEBRA  store).  Finally,  at  the  end  of  each  drawing
(with  HIDE  on),  the  program  will  print  messages
about  the  memory  used  and  statistics  on  the
volumes'  visibility.  The  following  commands  will
produce  the  drawing  of  a  green  volume,  specified
by  NAME,  without  using  the  hidden  line  removal
technique,  using  the  hidden  line  removal
technique,  with  different  linewidth  and  colour
(red),  with  solid  colour,  with  shading  of
surfaces,  and  without  edges.  Finally,  some
examples  are  given  for  the  ray-tracing.  (A
possible  string  for  the  NAME  of  the  volume  can  be
found  using  the  command  DTREE).

To  draw  a  volume  shifted  from  its  initial
position  when  hidden  line  removal  is  ON.  It  can  be
useful  if  you  want  to  extract  a  volume  or  some
volumes  from  the  detector  to  show  them  more
clearly.  The  last  requested  SHIFT  for  each  volume
NAME  is  performed.  Moreover,  the  SHIFT  of  each
volume  will  be  performed  starting  from  where  its
mother  has  been  shifted,  so  that  it's  easier  to
SHIFT  nicely  sets  of  volumes  using  the
mother-daughter  relationships.  If  '.'  is  given  as
the  name  of  the  volume  to  be  shifted,  the  shifts
for  all  volumes  will  be  reset.  The  following
commands  will  produce  the  translation  along  the
Z-axis  of  the  previously  drawn  volume:
       EXAMPLE  -
       dopt  hide  on
       satt  *  seen  -2
       draw  NAME  40  40  0  10  10  .01  .01

                                position  ''    D=0.  R=-10.:10.



To  'explode'  the  detector.  If  BOOM  is  positive
(values  smaller  than  1.  are  suggested,  but  any
value  is  possible)  all  the  volumes  are  shifted  by
a  distance  proportional  to  BOOM  along  the
direction  between  their  centre  and  the  origin  of
the  MARS;  the  volumes  which  are  symmetric  with
respect  to  this  origin  are  simply  not  shown.  BOOM
equal  to  0  resets  the  normal  mode.  A  negative
(greater  than  -1.)  value  of  BOOM  will  cause  an
'implosion';  for  even  lower  values  of  BOOM  the
volumes'  positions  will  be  reflected  respect  to
the  origin.  This  command  can  be  useful  to  improve
the  3D  effect  for  very  complex  detectors.  The
following  commands  will  make  explode  the
detector:
       EXAMPLE  -
       dopt  hide  on
       satt  *  seen  1
       draw  NAME  40  40  0  10  10  .01  .01

This  command  allows  the  drawing  of  the  logical
tree,  displaying  the  name,  the  multiplicity  and
other  information  about  the  volumes,  via  a  call
to  GDTREE(name,levmax,isel):  if  the  third
parameter  is  not  given  (default),  the  command
will  produce  the  drawing  of  the  tree  displaying,
for  each  volume,  the  number  of  the  following
levels  (red  arrows)  and  of  the  preceeding  levels
(green  arrows);  then  the  control  is  automatically
given  to  the  mouse:  clicking  on  the  left  button
when  the  cursor  is  inside  a  volume's  pave  will
perform  a  DSPEC  for  that  volume;  doing  the  same
when  the  cursor  is  on  a  red  arrow,  will  perform  a



DTREE  for  the  relative  volume  (the  number  of
levels  displayed  depending  on  the  clicked  arrow);
doing  the  same  for  the  'i-th'  green  arrow  of  a
given  volume,  will  perform  a  DTREE  for  its
mother-volume  staying  'i'  levels  before.  If
running  with  X-windows,  the  drawing  of  the
specification  (DSPEC)  is  performed  in  a  different
window  to  speed  up  the  scanning  of  the  tree.
Iterating  this  procedure  it  is  possible  to
analyse  very  easily  and  quickly  any  kind  of  tree.
Clicking  the  right  button  of  the  mouse  will
return  the  control  to  the  command  mode.  If  the
ISELT  parameter  is  given,  then  the  TREE  will  work
as  in  the  previous  version,  with  ISELT  up  to
10001.  The  following  command  will  perform  a
drawing  of  the  tree  and  give  the  control  to  the
user  via  the  mouse:

Positioning  some  daughter  volumes  inside  a
'mother',  it  can  be  important  to  check  if
overlaps  between  such  volumes  have  occurred.
Instead  of  putting  the  drawing  in  a  view  bank,
zooming,  and  iterating  the  process  for  different
viewing  angles  of  the  same  detector,  the  MOVE
facility  has  been  developed  (for  machines  running
with  X11):  it  is  sufficient  to  draw  a  view  of  the
volumes  to  be  analysed  (after  setting  the  proper
SEEN,  COLO,  etc.  attributes)  and  then  to  enter
'MOVE'  followed  by  the  same  'NAME'  used  for  the
last  command  DRAW.  The  detector  will  appear  in  a
panel  with  five  buttons  at  the  bottom:  THETA,
PHI,  TRASL,  ZOOM,  OFF.  Clicking  on  the  left
button  of  the  mouse,  when  the  cursor  is  inside  the
THETA  area,  will  rotate  the  detector  along  the
polar  angle  theta  according  to  the
backward-to-forward  movement  of  the  mouse
(clicking  up  and  down  the  left  button  if  not  in
sample  mode);  clicking  on  the  right  button  of  the
mouse  will  stop  the  rotation;  clicking  now  on  the
left  button  of  the  mouse  when  inside  the  PHI  area
will  activate  a  rotation  along  the  polar  angle
phi.  In  the  same  way,  activating  the  TRASL
button,  the  detector  can  be  translated  in  the  u,v
plane  of  the  screen  according  to  the  2D-movement
of  the  mouse.  Finally,  activating  the  ZOOM
button,  the  detector  will  be  zoomed  (or  unzoomed)
according  to  the  backward-to-forward  movement  of
the  mouse.  Clicking  on  the  OFF  button  will  return
the  control  to  the  'command  mode'.  The  MOVE
command  will  work  also  with  hidden  line  removal
and  shading  options  (when  SHAD  is  on  the
background  will  be  black);  moreover,  if  the



volumes  are  clipped,  exploded,  shifted,  etc.,
they  will  be  'MOVED'  with  these  features  as  well.
Tracks  and  hits  of  a  previously  stored  physical
event  can  be  moved  together  with  the  detector,
allowing  a  dynamical  3-D  analysis  of  the
simulated  events.  Clicking  the  central  button  of
the  mouse  when  a  good  view  of  the  event  is  found,
will  stop  any  movement  and  the  mouse  will  allow
the  normal  picking  capabilities  first  for  the
tracks  and  then  for  the  hits.  After  clicking  of
the  right  button,  the  normal  movement  will
restart  to  find  another  interesting  view  of  the
event  and  to  iterate  the  process.  The  MOVE  is  also
available  in  sample  mode.  The  following  commands
will  produce  a  drawing  of  a  volume  and  then  will
give  the  control  to  the  MOVE  panel;  try  the
following  possibilities:

Interactive  zooming  for  detectors  and  events  when
running  with  X-windows.  Using  this  command,  when
showing  the  contents  of  a  view  bank,  it  is
possible  to  click  (left  button)  in  two  points  of
the  drawing  (which  will  represent  the  left  upper
corner  and  the  right  bottom  corner  of  the  part  to
be  zoomed).  After  the  second  click  a  new  'window'
will  appear  to  fit  the  frame  defined  by  the  two
clicks  and  it  will  show  a  zoomed  view  as  seen  from
a  lens  with  those  dimensions.  Clicking  now  the
central  button  will  translate  the  lens  over  the
drawing,  while  clicking  the  right  button  will
stop  it.  Moreover,  clicking  the  left  button  of
the  mouse,  the  lens  will  increase  (or  decrease)
its  magnification  power  according  to  the
backward-to-forward  movement  of  the  mouse.  A
click  on  the  right  button  will  stop  this  action
and  it  is  possible  to  restart  the  translation  of
the  lens  or,  clicking  on  the  right  button  again,
to  make  the  lens  disappear.  It  is  then  possible  to
open  another  'window-lens'  with  different
dimensions.  Thus,  this  command  can  be  useful  to
scan  detailed  parts  of  a  detector  or  to  scan  hits
and  showers  for  events.  Clicking  the  right  button
when  no  lens  is  displayed  will  return  the  control
to  the  'command  mode'.  The  LENS  is  also  available

time  to  be  executed,  it  can  be  useful  to  store  it
in  a  view  bank:  after  a  call  to  DOPEN  and  the

the  screen),  and  after  a  necessary  call  to
DCLOSE,  the  contents  of  the  bank  can  be  displayed
in  a  very  fast  way  through  a  call  to  DSHOW;
therefore,  the  detector  can  be  easily  zoomed  many

                       LSTY=7  will  produce  a  very  precise  approximation  for

                       LWID<0  will  act  as  abs(LWID)  was  set  for  the  volume

                       (whereas  the  FILL  value  represent  their  number).  Therefore
                       tuning  this  parameter  will  help  to  obtain  the  desired

      'm';
                       colour=n*10+m,  m=1,2,...9,  will  produce  the  same  colour
                       as  'n',  but  with  increasing  luminosity  according  to  'm';
                       COLO<0  will  act  as  if  abs(COLO)  was  set  for  the  volume
                       and  for  all  the  levels  below  it.
                       When  for  a  volume  the  attribute  FILL  is  >  1  (and  the
                       option  SHAD  is  on),  the  ABS  of  its  colour  code  must  be  <  8
                       because  an  automatic  shading  of  its  faces  will  be
                       performed.

                       volume  can  be  set  different  from  0  (normal  drawing);



                       if  it  is  set  to  1,  the  faces  of  such  volume  will  be  filled
                       with  solid  colours;  if  ABS(FILL)  is  >  1,  then  a  light
                       source  is  placed  along  the  observer  line,  and  the  faces  of
                       such  volumes  will  be  painted  by  colours  whose  luminosity
                       will  depend  on  the  amount  of  light  reflected;
                       if  ABS(FILL)  =  1,  then  it  is  possible  to  use  all  the  166
                       colours  of  the  colour  table,  becouse  the  automatic  shading
                       is  not  performed;
                       for  increasing  values  of  FILL  the  drawing  will  be  performed
                       with  higher  and  higher  resolution  improving  the  quality  (the
                       number  of  scan  lines  used  to  fill  the  faces  increases  with  FILL);
                       it  is  possible  to  set  different  values  of  FILL
                       for  different  volumes,  in  order  to  optimize  at  the  same  time
                       the  performance  and  the  quality  of  the  picture;
                       FILL<0  will  act  as  if  abs(FILL)  was  set  for  the  volume
                       and  for  all  the  levels  below  it.
                       This  kind  of  drawing  can  be  saved  in  'picture  files'
                       or  in  view  banks.
