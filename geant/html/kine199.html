       Figure  1:  Layout  of  the  JVERTX  data  structure



JV            =  LQ(JVERTX-IVERT)  pointer  to  the  bank  of
              vertex  IVERT.
JVU           =  LQ(JV-1)  pointer  to  the  user  part  of  the
              bank.


The  JVERTX  banks  are  filled  by  the  routine  GSVERT
and  GSVERU.  Vertex  parameters  can  be  retrieved  by
the  routine  GFVERT  and  printed  by  the  routine
GPVERT.

        Figure  2:  Layout  of  the  JKINE  data  structure



JK            =  LQ(JKINE-ITRA)  pointer  to  the  bank  of
              track  ITRA.
JKU           =  LQ(JK-1)  pointer  to  the  user  part  of  the
              bank.


The  JKINE  banks  are  filled  by  the  routine  GSKINE
and  GSKINU.  Track  parameters  can  be  retrieved  by
the  routine  GFKINE  and  printed  by  the  routine
GPKINE.
