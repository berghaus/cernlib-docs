       CALL  GGCLOS



This  routine  should  be  called  after  all  volumes,
positions,  hits  and  digits  have  been  defined.  Its
action  is  confined  to  clean  up  the  volume  banks
and  to  take  any  action  required  by  the  ordering
techniques.


GGCLOS  performs  all  the  requested  geometry
optimisation,  included  the  creation  of
pseudo-divisions  in  volumes  flagged  by  GSORD.  It
performs  the  local  development  of  tha  last  leaves
of  the  geometrical  tree,  where  applicable.


It  also  calls  the  routine  GGDETV  which  prepares
the  prototype  lists  of  volume  names  and  maximum
multiplicities  which  permit  to  identify  uniquely
any  sensitive  detector  whose  generic  name  has
been  declared  through  the  routine  GSDETV  (and  not
GSDET)  [HITS001].


GGCLOS  must  be  called  also  after  reading  a
geometry  data  structure  from  disk.
