</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Drawing  the  geometrical
tree</H2>


<PRE>    The  geometrical  tree  is  a  hierarchical
representation  of  the  structure  of  the  detector,
based  on  the  mother-daughter  relationship  among
the  various  volumes  composing  it.  The  GDTREE
routine  (corresponding  to  the  DTREE  interactive
command)  allows  the  drawing  of  the  logical  tree,
displaying  name,  multiplicity  and  other
information  about  the  volumes.

   Figure  1:  Example  of  geometrical  tree  structure



GDTREE  draws  the  tree  of  the  volume  data
structure  starting  from  the  volume  CHNAME,  for
LEVMAX  depth  levels;  a  continuation  link  line  is
drawn  for  those  elements  at  the  last  level  on  the
picture  but  having  descendants.  An  example  of  use
of  GDTREE  can  be  found  in  Fig.  ??    .  For  every  node,
as  many  red  arrows  as  the  number  of  existing
levels  below  it  are  plotted  on  the  link;  vice
versa,  as  many  green  arrows  as  the  number  of
existing  levels  before  it  are  also  plotted.  When
running  GEANT  interactively,  if  the  ISEL  argument
is  not  specified,  control  is  given  to  the  mouse
after  issuing  the  DTREE  command.  This  allows  the
display  of  various  volume  parameters  and  the
navigation  of  the  geometrical  tree  by  clicking
the  mouse  buttons.  The  size  of  the  picture  and  the
dimensions  of  each  element  and  arrows  are
computed  automatically.

Interactive  use  In  an  interactive  session,
control  can  be  given  to  the  mouse:


   *   clicking  on  the  left  button  when  the  cursor  is
       inside  a  volume  pave  will  generate  a  DSPEC
       command  for  that  volume;
   *   clicking  the  same  button  when  the  cursor  is  on
       a  red  arrow  will  perform  a  DTREE  for  the  volume
       preceding  the  arrow,  displaying  a  number  of
       levels  which  depends  on  the  which  arrow  has



       been  selected;

                                            th
   *   selecting  in  the  same  way  the  i        green  arrow
       preceding  a  given  volume  will  perform  a  DTREE
       for  its  mother-volume  staying  i  levels  before;
   *   clicking  the  right  button  of  the  mouse  will
       return  the  control  to  the  command  mode.


When  running  with  the  X-windows  software,  the
drawing  of  the  specification  (DSPEC)  appears  in  a
different  window  to  speed  up  the  scanning  of  the
tree.  Iterating  this  procedure  it  is  possible  to
analyse  very  easily  and  quickly  any  kind  of
geometry.  This  drawing  tree  capability  can  be
very  useful  when  tuning  the  detector  geometry.
See  the  interactive  section  [XINT]  for  examples.
