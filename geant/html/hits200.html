       CALL  GSAHIT                         (ISET,IDET,ITRA,NUMBV,HITS,IHIT*)



ISET                      (INTEGER)  set  number  (see  below);
IDET                      (INTEGER)  detector  number;
ITRA                      (INTEGER)  number  of  the  track  producing
                          this  hit
NUMBV                     (INTEGER)  array  of  volume  numbers
                          corresponding  to  list  NAMESV  of  GSDET;
HITS                      (REAL)  array  of  values  for  current  hit
                          elements;
IHIT                      (INTEGER)  current  hit  number,  if  0  the
                          hit  has  not  been  stored.


Stores  element  values  for  current  hit  into  the
data  structure  JHITS.  The  values  ISET,  IDET  and
NUMBV  can  be  found  in  the  corresponding  variables
of  common  /GCSETS/.  These  values  are  set  by  the
routine  GFINDS  every  time  that  a  particle  is  in  a
defined  detector.



       CALL  GSCHIT                         (ISET,IDET,ITRA,NUMBV,HITS,NHSUM,IHIT*)



Same  action  as  GSAHIT,  but  in  case  the  detector
identified  by  ISET,  IDET  and  NUMBV  contains
already  a  hit  for  the  same  track,  the  routine  will
make  a  cummulative  sum  for  the  latest  NHSUM
elements  of  JHITS.  The  other  previous  elements  of
JHITS  are  replaced.  That  facility  is  particularly
interesting  in  the  case  of  hits  generated  into  a
calorimeter.  No  packing  (i.e.  32  bits  per  hit
element)  should  be  requested  for  the  last  NHSUM
hits  in  GSDETH  and  for  these  hits  ORIG  should  be
set  to  0.



       CALL  GPHITS                         (CHSET,CHDET)



CHSET                     (CHARACTER*4)  set  name,  if  '*'  prints
                          all  JHITS  banks  of  all  sets;
CHDET                     (CHARACTER*4)  detector  name,  if  '*'
                          prints  hits  in  all  detectors  of  set
                          CHSET.


Prints  JHITS  banks  for  detector  CHDET  of  set
CHSET.



       CALL  GFHITS                         (CHSET,CHDET,NVDIM,NHDIM,NHMAX,ITRS,NUMVS,
                                            ITRA*,NUMBV*,HITS*,NHITS*)



CHSET                     (CHARACTER*4)  set  name;
CHDET                     (CHARACTER*4)  detector  name;

                                      st
NVDIM                     (INTEGER)  1        dimension  of  arrays  NUMBV
                          and  NUMVS:  1< =    NVDIM< =    NV  argument  of
                          GSDET;

                                      st
NHDIM                     (INTEGER)  1        dimension  of  array  HITS:
                          1< =    NHDIM< =    NH  argument  of  GSDETH;
NHMAX                     (INTEGER)  maximum  number  of  hits  to  be
                          returned,  this  should  be  not  larger  than
                          the  second  dimension  of  array  NUMBV  and
                          HITS;
ITRS                      (INTEGER)  number  of  the  selected  track,
                          if  ITRS=0,  all  tracks  are  taken;
NUMVS                     (INTEGER)  is  a  1-dimension  array  of
                          NVDIM  elements  that  contains  the  list  of
                          volume  numbers  which  identify  the
                          selected  detector,  0  is  interpreted  as
                          'all  valid  numbers';
ITRA                      (INTEGER)  is  a  1-dim  array  of  dimension
                          NHMAX  that  contains  on  output  for  each
                          hit  the  number  of  the  track  which  has
                          produced  it;
NUMBV                     (INTEGER)  2-dim  array  (NVDIM,NHMAX)
                          that  containis  on  output  for  each  hit
                          the  list  of  volume  numbers  which
                          identify  the  detector,  all  values  set  to
                          0  means  that  no  more  volumes  are  stored;
HITS                      (REAL)  2-dim  array  (NHDIM,NHMAX)  that
                          containis  NHITS  hits;
NHITS                     (INTEGER)  number  of  hits  returned,  in
                          case  the  total  number  of  hits  is  greater
                          than  NHMAX,  NHITS  is  set  to  NHMAX+1  and
                          NHMAX  hits  are  returned.


This  rotine  returns  the  hits  produced  by  track
ITRS  (or  by  any  track)  in  the  detector  CHDET
identified  by  the  list  NUMVS  belonging  to  set



CHSET.


HITS(1,I)                            is  element  1  of  hit  number  I;
NUMBV(1,I)                           is  volume  number  1  of  hit  number  I;
ITRA(I)                              is  the  track  number  corresponding
                                     to  hit  number  I;


The  arrays  NUMVS,  NUMBV,  HITS  and  ITRA  must  be
dimensioned  to:
       NUMVS(NVDIM)
       NUMBV(NVDIM,NHMAX)
       HITS(NHDIM,NHMAX)
       ITRA(NHMAX)



       CALL  GFPATH                         (ISET,IDET,NUMBV,NLEV*,LNAM*,LNUM*)



ISET                      (INTEGER)  set  number;
IDET                      (INTEGER)  detector  number;
NUMBV                     (INTEGER)  array  of  numbers  which
                          identify  uniquely  detector  number  IDET;
NLEV                      (INTEGER)  number  of  elements  filled  of
                          arrays  LNAM  and  LNUM;
LNAM                      (INTEGER)  array  of  NLEV  volume  names
                          stored  in  ASCII  code  in  integers;
LNUM                      (INTEGER)  array  of  NLEV  copy  numbers.


This  routine  returns  the  list  of  volume  names  and
numbers  which  identify  the  complete  ancestry  in
the  JVOLUM  data  structure  of  the  volume
corresponding  to  the  detector  number  IDET  in  set
number  ISET  and  which  is  identified  by  the  volume
numbers  NUMBV  (see  GFHITS).


GFPATH  assumes  that  the  detectors  have  been
declared  via  GSDETV  and  not  GSDET.  The  main  use  of
GFPATH  is  to  prepare  the  lists  LNAM  and  LNUM
required  by  the  routine  GLVOLU  to  fill  the  common
/GCVOLU/.  Once  /GCVOLU/  is  properly  filled,  it  is
possible  to  use  the  GEANT  routines  to  transform
from  the  local  to  the  master  reference  system  and
so  on.
