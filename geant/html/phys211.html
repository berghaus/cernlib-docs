       CALL  GPAIRG



GPAIRG  generates  e-e+-pair  production  by
photons.  It  uses  a  modified  version  of  the  random
number  techniques  of  Butcher  and  Messel    to
sample  the  secondary  electron/positron  energies
from  the  Coulomb  corrected  Bethe-Heitler
differential  cross-section.  For  the  angular
distribution  of  the  pair,  it  calls  the  function
GBTETH.


Input:  via  COMMON  /GCTRAK/


Output:  via  COMMON  /GCKING/


GPAIRG  is  called  from  GTGAMA,  when  the  photon
reaches  its  pair  production  point.



       VALUE    =    GBTETH                            (ENER,PARTM,EFRAC)



GBTETH  calculates  the  angular  distribution  of  the
e-e+-pair  for  pair  production  and  of  the  photon
for  bremsstrahlung.  In  case  of  e-e+-pair
production  by  photons,  it  gives  the  scaled  angle
for  an  electron  (mass  PARTM)  of  energy  ENER  which
is  EFRAC  times  the  initial  energy  of  the  photon.
GBTETH  is  called  by  GPAIRG.

 <H3>MonteCarlo  technique</H3>


 <PRE>


 We  give  a  very  short  summary  of  the  random  number
 technique  used  here  .  The  method  is  a  combination
 of  the  composition  and  rejection  Monte  Carlo
 methods.  Suppose  we  wish  to  sample  x  from  the
 distribution  f(x)  and  the  (normalised)
 probability  density  function  can  be  written  as



                                          n
                               f(x) = sum        alpha            f   (x)g   (x)                                             (1)
                                       i=1                     i   i      i



 where  f   (x)  are  normalised  density  functions,
         i

 alpha            >0  and  0< =    g   (x)< =    1.
               i                    i


 According  to  this  method,  x  can  sampled  in  the
 following  way:


1.      select  a  random  integer  i  such  that  (1< =    i< =    n)
        with  probability  proportional  to  alpha
                                                           i

2.      select  a  value  x'  from  the  distribution  f   (x)
                                                        i

3.      calculate  g   (x')  and  accept  x = x'  with
                    i

        probability  g   (x');
                      i

4.      if  x'  is  rejected  restart  from  step  1.


 It  can  be  shown  that  this  scheme  is  correct  and
 the  mean  number  of  tries  to  accept  a  value  is
 sum        alpha            .
     i                    i



 In  practice  we  have  a  good  method  of  sampling  from
 the  distribution  f(x),  if


    *   all  the  subdistributions  f   (x)  can  be  sampled
                                     i

        easily;
    *   the  rejection  functions  g   (x)  can  be  evaluated
                                    i



       easily/quickly;
   *   the  mean  number  of  tries  is  not  too  large.


Thus  the  different  possible  decompositions  of  the
distribution  f(x)  are  not  equivalent  from  the
practical  point  of  view  (e.g.  they  can  be  very
different  in  computational  speed)  and  it  can  be
very  useful  to  optimise  the  decomposition.  A
remark  of  practical  importance  is  that  if  our
distribution  is  not  normalised
(R   f(x)dx = C>0; C ss 1),  the  method  can  be  used  in  the
same  manner,  the  only  difference  is  that  the  mean
number  of  tries  in  this  case  is  given  by
sum        alpha            / C  .

The  kinematical  range  for  the  variable  epsilon              is


                     ((m)/ (E))< =    epsilon            < =    1- ((m)/ (E))                                               (3)


The  cross-section  is  symmetric  with  respect  to
the  interchange  of  epsilon              with  1- epsilon            ,  so  we
can  restrict  epsilon              to  lie  in  the  range

        return  to  step  1.


 It  should  be  mentioned  that  we  need  a  step  just
 after  sampling  epsilon              in  the  step  2,  because  the
 cross-section  formula  becomes  negative  at  large
 delta           and  this  imposes  an  upper  limit  for  delta         ;


     delta                   = exp       [((42. 24- F(Z))/ (8. 368))]- 0. 952

 If  we  get  a  delta           value  using  the  sampled  epsilon
 such  that  delta         >delta                    ,  we  have  to  start  again
                                          max

 from  the  step  1.  After  the  successful  sampling  of
 epsilon             ,  GPAIRG  generates  the  polar  angles  of  the
 electron  with  respect  to  an  axis  defined  along
 the  direction  of  the  parent  photon.  The  electron
 and  the  positron  are  assumed  to  have  a  symmetric
 angular  distribution.  The  energy-angle
 distribution  is  given  by  Tsai    as  following:

 furthermore,  considered  as  function  of  the
 variable  u = Etheta         / m,  it  shows  a  very  weak
 dependence  on  Z,  E,  k,  x = E/ k.  Thus,  the
 distribution  can  be  approximated  by  a  function

 The  sampling  of  the  function  f(u)  can  be  done  in

 The  azimuthal  angle,  phi     ,  is  generated
 isotropically.


 This  information  together  with  the  momentum
 conservation  is  used  to  calculate  the  momentum
 vectors  of  both  decay  products  and  to  transform
 them  to  the  GEANT  coordinate  system.  The  choice
 of  which  particle  in  the  pair  is  the
 electron/positron  is  made  randomly.

1.      Effects  due  to  the  breakdown  of  Born
        approximation  at  low  energies  are  ignored  (but
        the  Coulomb  correction  is  now  included):
2.      as  suggested  by  Ford  and  Nelson  ,  for  very  low
        energy  photons  (E< =    2. 1MeV)  the  electron



        energy  is  approximated  by  sampling  from  a
        uniform  distribution  over  the  interval
        m- >   1/ (2E).  The  reason  for  this  suggestion  is
        that  the  sampling  method  used  in  EGS  and  in  the
        earlier  GEANT  versions  becomes  progressively
        more  inefficient  as  the  pair  threshold  is
        approached.  This  is  not  true  for  the  sampling
        method  outlined  above  (the  efficiency  of  the
        method  practically  does  not  depend  on  the
        photon  energy),  but  we  have  chosen  to  keep  this
        approximation;
3.      target  materials  composed  of  compounds  or
        mixtures  are  treated  identically  to  chemical
        elements  (this  is  not  the  case  when  computing
        the  mean  free  path!)  using  the  effective  atomic
        number  computed  in  the  routine  GSMIXT.  It  can
        be  shown  that  the  error  of  this  type  of
        treatment  is  small  and  can  be  neglected;
4.      the  differential  cross-section  implicitly
        accounts  for  pair  production  in  both  nuclear
        and  atomic  electron  fields.  However,  triplet
        production  is  not  generated,  and  the  recoil
        momentum  of  the  target  nucleus/electron  is
        assumed  to  be  zero.
