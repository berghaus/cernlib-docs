LUN                       (INTEGER)  logical  unit  number,

CHOPT                     (CHARACTER*(*))  any  valid  combination

LEN                       (INTEGER)  maximum  record  length,  for
                          more  details  see  routine  FZFILE  in  the
                          ZEBRA  manual;

                                        sequential  files;


Opens  a  ZEBRA  FZ  file  for  sequential  I/O  of  GEANT
data  structures.  No  more  than  5  files  can  be  open
at  any  one  time.



       CALL  GCLOSE                         (LUN,IER*)



LUN                       (INTEGER)  logical  unit  to  be  closed,  if
                          0  all  ZEBRA  FZ  streams  will  be  closed;
IER                       (INTEGER)  error  flag:

                          0             legal  close  request;
                          1             no  unit  was  found  open;


This  routine  closes  one  or  all  ZEBRA  FZ  file(s).
This  is  a  mandatory  routines  for  all  open  ZEBRA
files  before  the  end  of  the  program.  Failure  to
call  this  routine  may  cause  files  to  be
incompletely  written  to  the  storage  media.
