<H2>Visualisation  of  particle  trajectories</H2>


<PRE>


The  tracks  generated  by  the  tracking  package,  and
optionally  stored  in  the  data  structure  JXYZ,  can
be  displayed  by  the  routine  GDXYZ  (corresponding
to  the  interactive  command  DXYZ).


The  names  of  the  particles  and  or  the  track
numbers  can  be  added  by  the  routine  GDPART
(corresponding  to  the  interactive  command
DPART).


A  special  routine  has  been  provided  to  visualise
the  tracks  during  the  transport  process  (GDCXYZ),
that  could  be  called  for  instance  by  GUSTEP.  That
routine  shows  the  tracks  while  they  are
transported  by  the  tracking  package  of  GEANT,
providing  a  useful  interactive  debugging  tool.



       CALL  GDXYZ                       (ITRA)



Draws  track  number  ITRA  for  which  space  points
have  been  stored  in  bank  JXYZ  via  calls  to  the
routine  GSXYZ.  The  view  parameters  are  taken  from
/GCDRAW/.


ITRA       (INTEGER)  track  number  (if  0  all  tracks  are
           taken)


The  colour  and  line  style  corresponds  to  the
track  type  :



    (blue)                       dotted  line  for  gammas                                                                         *
 *                     @



    (red)                        solid  line  for  charged  particles  (except  muons)                                             *
 *                     @



    (black)                      blank/dotted  line  for  neutral  hadrons  or  neutrinos



    (green)                      dashed  line  for  muons



    (yellow)                     dotted  line  for  Cerenkov  photons                                                              *
 *                     @



       CALL  GDPART                         (ITRA,ISEL,SIZE)



Draws  the  particle  names  and/or  the  track  numbers
of  track  ITRA,  supposing  that  its  space  points
had  been  stored  in  the  bank  JXYZ  via  the  routine
GSXYZ.  At  present  only  primary  tracks  are
displayed  by  GDPART  and  their  name  or  number  is
written  at  the  end  the  track  trajectory.  The  view
parameters  are  taken  from  /GCDRAW/.


ITRA          (INTEGER)  Track  number  (if  0  all  tracks  are
              taken)
ISEL          (INTEGER)
              ISEL=x1  draws  the  track  number,
              ISEL=1x  draws  the  particle  name,
              ISEL=11  draws  both.
SIZE          (REAL)  Character  size  in  cm.



       CALL  GDCXYZ



If  GDCXYZ  is  called  at  tracking  time  (for
instance  by  GUSTEP),  it  draws  the  tracks  while
tracking  is  performed,  at  the  same  time  as  they
are  generated  by  the  tracking  package  of  GEANT.
This  is  a  very  useful  interactive  debugging  tool.
The  line  style  is  the  same  as  for  GDXYZ.  The  view
parameters  are  taken  from  /GCDRAW/.


Here  we  give  an  example  of  the  use  of  GDPART:
  CALL  GSATT('HB','FILL',3)
  CALL  GSATT('HE','FILL',1)
  -  -  -  -  -
  -  -  -  -  -


  CALL  GDRAWC('OPAL',2,5.,10.,10.,0.013,0.013)
  CALL  GDXYZ(0)
  CALL  GDPART(0,11,0.25)
