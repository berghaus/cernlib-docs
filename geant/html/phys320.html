A  charged  particle  traversing  a  medium  is
deflected  by  many  scatters,  mostly  at  small
angle.  These  scatters  are  due  to  the  interaction
with  the  Coulomb  field  of  the  nuclei,  and  to  a
lesser  degree,  to  the  electron  field,  hence  the
name  of  Coulomb  scattering.  For  hadronic
projectiles,  however,  the  strong  interaction
contributes  to  multiple  scattering.  Multiple



scattering  is  well  described  by  Moliere  theory  .
Moliere  multiple  scattering  theory  is  used  by
default  in  GEANT  (see  [PHYS325]).  We  define

                                  rms                            rms             p  ===
theta             = theta                        = theta                       /    2   as  the  r.m.s.

of  the  angle  between  the  directions  projected  on
a  plane  of  a  particle  before  and  after  traversing
a  thickness  t  of  absorber.  In  this  case  a  simple
form  for  the  multiple  Coulomb  scattering  of
singly  charged  particles  which  is  widely  used  is:



                                                          2     p  =============================
              theta             ss ((15MeV)/ (Ebeta           ))   ((t)/ (X   ))

where  X     is  the  radiation  length  of  the  absorber.
        0

This  form  was  proposed  by  ,  .  It  can  introduce
large  errors  because  it  ignores  significant
dependences  from  pathlength  and  Z.  To  compensate
for  this,  a  similar  formula  was  proposed  ,  :



                                               2     p  =============================
theta             ss ((14. 1MeV)/ (Ebeta           ))   ((t)/ (X   ))                [1+0. 038 log       (((t)/ (X   )))]
              0                                                 0                                                 0

                                                                                                                            (1)


A  form  taking  into  account  the  beta         and  z
dependence  of  the  particle  has  been  proposed  by  :

The  problem  with  the  formulae  (??    )  and  (??    )  is
that  if  the  distance  t  in  the  absorber  is

MonteCarlo  like  GEANT.


Much  of  the  difficulty  in  approximating  multiple
Coulomb  scattering  in  terms  of  the  radiation
length  is  that  the  number  of  radiation  lengths  is
a  poor  measure  of  the  scattering.  A  better
expression,  which  is  used  in  GEANT  has  been
proposed  by  :



              2                2         2
theta             = ((chi         )/ (1+F   ))[((1+nu    )/ (nu    )) log       (1+nu    )- 1]

Omega                    =        ((chi         )/ (1. 167chi                    ))          is  the  mean  number  of  scatters

In  GEANT  we  have  adopted  the  values  of  F = 0. 98  and
Omega             = 40, 000  scatters,  obtaining  the  following
              0

formula:
