       CALL  GMUNUI



GMUNUI  computes  and  stores  in  the  appropriate
bank  the  value  of  the  muon-nucleus  cross-section
for  a  given  material.  It  is  called  at
initialisation  time  by  GPHYSI.



       CALL  GMUNU



GMUNU  is  called  by  GTMUON  every  time  a
muon-nucleus  interaction  has  to  happen.  It
generates  the  final  state  particles  as  well  as
the  outgoing  muon.  A  call  to  GUHADR  is  performed
if  IMUNU  (which  is  the  variable  set  by  the  MUNU
data  record)  is  equal  to  1.  An  inelastic
interaction  is  forced  (which  could  also  be  a
fission  in  case  of  heavy  materials).  The
secondaries  from  the  pi    -nucleus  interaction  are
always  generated  if  IMUNU  is  equal  to  1,
irrespectively  of  the  value  of  IHADR.


Note:  IMUNU  should  be  set  to  1  only  when  using  the
GHEISHA  hadronic  interactions  package.  Setting
it  to  1  when  using  FLUKA  can  give  unpredictable
results.



       VALUE    =    GMUSIG                            (E,E1,COSTET)



E                         (REAL)  initial  mu     energy;
E1                        (REAL)  final  mu     energy;
COSTET                    (REAL)  mu     scattering  angle.


This  function  returns  the  value  of  the
differential  cross-section  in  millibarns  for  a
muon  of  energy  E  to  generate  a  nuclear
interaction  recoil  with  energy  E1  at  an  angle  the
cosine  of  which  is  COSTET.

<H2>Method</H2>


<PRE>


This  set  of  routines  generates  the  interactions
of  muons  with  the  nuclei  of  the  tracking
material.  The  code  is  a  straight  translation  into
the  GEANT  style  of  the  corresponding  code  from
the  GHEISHA  Monte  Carlo  Program.  The  GHEISHA
routines  CASMU  and  CALIM  have  been  used  .


The  information  contained  in  this  chapter  is
mainly  taken  from  the  GHEISHA  manual  to  which  the
user  is  referred.  The  muon-nucleus  inelastic
cross-section  is  taken  as  0.0003  mb  for  a  nucleon
when  the  energy  of  the  incoming  muon  is  E<30  GeV,
and  slowly  increases  for  E>30  GeV  according  to
the  law:



                                                          0.25
                            sigma          = 0. 3* (E/ 30)               [mu    b]



The  energy  and  angle  of  final  state  muon  is
generated  according  to  the  ``free  quark  parton
model''.  If  E  is  the  energy  of  the  incoming  muon
and  Omega           and  W  the  angle  and  the  energy  of  the
outgoing  muon,  the  differential  cross-section
can  be  written  as:



((dsigma         )/ (dOmega         dW)) = gamma         (sigma            +epsilon             sigma            )
                                                                        T                                     S

where:

      Gamma                =         ((kalpha         )/ (2pi    ))((W)/ (E))((1)/ (1- epsilon            ))



                                              2          2        2             2                 2
epsilon                    =         [1 + 2((Q    + nu       )/ (Q   )) tan         theta            ]

Q     and  nu     are  the  normal  scaling  variables
expressed  by:



  2       2                                            2
 Q    =- q    = 2(EW- _p__p'_cos      theta         - m         )   and        nu     = E- W

                                                       -mu


here  sigma              and  sigma              are  the  photo-absorption
                    T                       S

cross-sections  for  transverse  and  longitudinal
photons  respectively  for  which  the  relation  used
is:



                                                        2
            sigma             = 0. 3(1- ((1)/ (1. 868))Q     nu    )sigma
                          S                                                       T


and  sigma              is  assumed  to  be  constant  sigma             = 0. 12
                   T                                                 T

mb.  For  the  incident  flux  K  of  the  photons
Gillman's  convention  is  used:


                                                              2
                                                 K = nu    + Q   / 2nu


A  three-dimensional  importance  sampling  in  the
variables  E,  W  and  theta           is  performed  each  time  an
interaction  has  to  occur.


This  set  of  routines  only  works  if  GUPHAD  calls
GPGHEI  and  GUHADR  calls  GHEISH.  The  hadrons  are
generated  in  an  approximate  way.  The  virtual
photon  is  replaced  by  a  real  pion  of  random  charge
with  the  same  kinetic  energy.  Then  the  GUHADR
routine  is  called  to  generate  a  pi    -nucleus
inelastic  scattering.  While  the  final  state
generated  this  way  gives  a  good  approximation  for
calorimetric  purposes,  the  kinematics  of  the
final  state  may  be  a  rather  poor  approximation  of
reality.  The  muon-nucleus  interactions  are
activated  by  the  MUNU  data  record  of  GEANT.  After
a  muon-nucleus  interaction  the  muon  will  still  be
the  current  particle.  If  MUNU  1  has  been
specified,  secondaries  coming  from  the
interaction  of  the  virtual  photon  with  the
nucleus  will  be  in  the  GEANT  temporary  stack.  If
MUNU  2  has  been  specified,  then  the  secondary
particles  will  not  be  generated  and  the  energy
lost  by  the  muon  will  be  added  to  DESTEP.  For  each
material  a  table  of  muon-nucleus  cross-sections
is  stored  at  initialisation  time.  See  material
bank  structure  for  details.
