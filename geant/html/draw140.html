 </PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Drawing  Track  Hits  in  Sensitive
 Detectors</H2>


 <PRE>    The  hits  generated  by  the  tracking  package
 and  stored  in  the  data  structure  JHITS  can  be
 displayed  by  the  following  routines:


1.      draw  one  hit  (GDAHIT);  called  by  the  user;
2.      draw  all  the  hits  of  trajectory  type  sets/
        detectors  (GDHITS);
3.      draw  all  the  hits  of  calorimeter  type  sets/
        detectors  (GDCHIT).


 Different  symbols  for  each  subdetector  can  be
 used,  chosen  among  hardware  characters  (dots),
 software  crosses,  or  from  the  HPLOT  table  of
 software  characters.  The  size  of  the  software
 characters  and  crosses  is  given  as  an  argument  to
 GDAHIT  and  GDHITS,  while  it  is  computed  as  a
 function  of  the  hits  value  in  GDCHIT.


 The  option  H  of  the  interactive  MOVE  command
 gives  the  possibility  to  rotate,  zoom  and
 translate  in  real  time  the  hits  stored  for  one
 event.  This  allow  a  3D  display  of  the  event  where
 it  is  possible  to  pick  one  hit  with  the  mouse  and
 have  the  hit  values  printed.  The  interactive
 command  LENS  allows  a  detailed  visual  scanning  of
 the  hits  displayed  (see  the  interactive  section).

 Draws  the  hit  points  as  stored  by  GSAHIT,  which
 were  generated  by  track  ITRA  in  detector  CHUDET
 of  set  CHUSET,  with  the  currently  selected  view
 parameters  in  /GCDRAW/.  The  character  plotted  at
 each  point  may  be  chosen  via  ISYMB:

More  information  on  the  meaning  of  the  ISIMB
value  can  be  found  in  the  HPLOT  manual.  Any  value
for  ISYMB  which  is  not  in  the  above  table  is
equivalent  to  option  0.  Except  for  ISYMB  =  -1,  the
size  of  the  character  can  be  chosen  by  SSYMB.  On
the  2D  projection  on  the  screen  one  can
distinguish  which  set/detector  a  given  track
passes,  by  drawing  different  symbols  for  the  hits
in  different  sets/detectors.  The  size  of  these
symbols  may  then  be  chosen  to  suit  the  scale  of
the  total  picture  (detectors  and  tracks).

Note:  It  is  obligatory  for  the  use  of  this  routine
that  the  spatial  MARS  (MAster  Reference  System)
current  coordinates  of  the  hits  are  stored  as  the
first  3  elements  of  the  hit  [HITS200].


CHUSET           (CHARACTER*4)  user  set  identifier  (if  '*'
                 all  sets  are  taken)
CHUDET           (CHARACTER*4)  user  detector  identifier  (if
                 '*'  all  detectors  are  taken)
ITRA             (INTEGER)  number  of  selected  track  (if  0
                 all  tracks  are  taken)



ISYMB            (INTEGER)  character  selection  number  (see
                 table  above)
SSYMB            (REAL)  size  of  characters  in  cm  (if  0,  a
                 default  of  0.1  is  taken)



       CALL  GDCHIT                         (CHUSET,CHUDET,ITRA,ISYMB,SIZMAX,IHIT,HITMIN,HITMAX)



Draws  the  hit  points  as  stored  by  GSCHIT,  which
were  generated  by  track  ITRA  in  detector  CHUDET
of  set  CHUSET,  with  the  currently  selected  view
parameters  in  /GCDRAW/.  Except  for  ISYMB  =  -1  the
size  of  the  character  is  chosen  as  a  function  of
HITS(IHIT):


    SIZE  =  sizmax  *  (  hits(ihit)  -  hitmin  )  /  hitmax


Note:  It  is  obligatory  for  the  use  of  this  routine
that  the  spatial  MARS  (MAster  Reference  System)
current  coordinates  of  the  hits  are  stored  as  the
first  3  elements  of  the  hit  [HITS200].


SIZMAX           (REAL)  maximum  character  size  in  cm
IHIT             (INTEGER)  HITS(IHIT)  contains  the
                 calorimeter  hit  value.  IHIT>3,  and  the
                 first  three  elements  are  supposed  to
                 contain  the  space  position  of  the  hit
HITMIN           (REAL)  minimum  boundary  of  HITS(IHIT)
HITMAX           (REAL)  maximum  boundary  of  HITS(IHIT)



       CALL  GDAHIT                         (X,Y,Z,ISYMB,SSYMB)



Draws  one  hit  point  at  coordinates  X,  Y,  Z.  This
routine  is  useful  when  the  user  wants  only  to
display  but  not  to  store  the  hits.  The  first  three
arguments  are  the  position  of  the  hit  in  the  MARS,
and  the  last  two  arguments  have  the  same  meaning
as  the  similar  arguments  in  GDHITS.


X        (REAL)  x  coordinate  in  MARS  of  the  hit  point
Y        (REAL)  y  coordinate  in  MARS  of  the  hit  point
X        (REAL)  z  coordinate  in  MARS  of  the  hit  point


An  example  of  use  of  the  hits  drawing  routines  is
given  in  fig  ??    .
