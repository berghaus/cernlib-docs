Method  For  a  compound  (NLMAT  <0),  the  molecular
weight  and  charge  are:


     A          = sum        n   A                                                 Z          = sum        n   Z
      mol             i       i   i                                                 mol             i       i   i



where  n     =  WMAT(I)  is  the  number  of  atoms  of  the
        i



 th
i        component  of  the  molecule.  In  this  case  the
proportion  by  weight  is:


                                       p    = ((n   A   )/ (A         ))
                                        i        i   i       mol


where  p     =  WMAT(I)  in  output.  From  the  relative
        i

weights,  GSMIXT  works  out  the  effective  atomic
weight  and  atomic  number  according  to  the
following  formulas:


     A          = sum        p   A                                                 Z          = sum        p   Z
      eff             i       i   i                                                 eff             i       i   i



which  are  stored  in  the  JMATE  data  structure
[CONS199]  together  with  the  radiation  length.


The  radiation  length  is  computed  according  to  the
EGS  manual  ,  formula  268  (37),  for  an  element:

The  effective  absorption  length  lambda             is  defined
as  the  interaction  length  of  a  5GeV  pion  in  the

Once  this  value  has  been  determined,  an  effective
hadronic  atomic  weight  (A               )  is  calculated  by
                            h-eff

the  routine  GHMIX    and  stored  in  the  data
structure.
