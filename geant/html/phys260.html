 <PRE>    Cerenkov  photons  are  produced  when  a
 charged  particle  traverses  a  dielectric
 material.

 <H2>Physics  processes  for  optical  photons</H2>


 <PRE>


 A  photon  is  called  optical  when  its  wavelength  is
 much  greater  than  the  typical  atomic  spacing,  for
 instance  when  lambda           > =   10nm  which  corresponds  to
 an  energy  E< =    100eV.  Production  of  an  optical
 photon  in  a  HEP  detector  is  primarily  due  to:


1.      Cerenkov  effect;
2.      Scintillation;
3.      Fluorescence.


 Fluorescence  is  taken  into  account  in  GEANT  in
 the  context  of  the  photoelectric  effect
 ([PHYS230],  [PHYS231]),  but  only  above  the  energy
 cut  CUTGAM.  Scintillation  is  not  yet  simulated  by
 GEANT.


 Optical  photons  undergo  three  kinds  of
 interactions:


1.      Elastic  (Rayleigh)  scattering;
2.      Absorption;
3.      Medium  boundary  interactions.


 </PRE>


 <H3>Elastic  scattering</H3>


 <PRE>


 For  optical  photons  elastic  scattering  is  usually
 unimportant.  For  lambda            =. 200mu    m  we  have
 sigma                                 ss. 2b  for  N     or  O     which  gives  a  mean
               Rayleigh                              2         2

 free  path  of  ss 1. 7  km  in  air  and  ss 1  m  in  quartz.  An
 important  exception  to  this  is  found  in  aerogel,
 which  is  used  as  a  Cerenkov  radiator  for  some



special  applications.  Because  of  the  spectral
properties  of  this  material,  Rayleigh  scattering
is  extremely  strong  and  this  limits  its
usefulness  as  a  RICH  radiator.  At  present,
elastic  scattering  of  optical  photons  is  not
simulated  in  GEANT.


</PRE>


<H3>Absorption</H3>


<PRE>


Absorption  is  important  for  optical  photons
because  it  determines  the  lower  lambda             limit  in
the  window  of  transparency  of  the  radiator.
Absorption  competes  with  photo-ionisation  in
producing  the  signal  in  the  detector,  so  it  must
be  treated  properly  in  the  tracking  of  optical
photons.


</PRE>


<H3>Medium  boundary  effects</H3>


<PRE>


When  a  photon  arrives  at  the  boundary  of  a
dielectric  medium,  its  behaviour  depends  on  the
nature  of  the  two  materials  which  join  at  that
boundary:


   *   Case  dielectric  - >     dielectric.
       The  photon  can  be  transmitted  (refracted  ray)
       or  reflected  (reflected  ray).  In  case  where  the
       photon  can  only  be  reflected,  total  internal
       reflection  takes  place.
   *   Case  dielectric  - >     metal.
       The  photon  can  be  absorbed  by  the  metal  or
       reflected  back  into  the  dielectric.  If  the
       photon  is  absorbed  it  can  be  detected  according
       to  the  photoelectron  efficiency  of  the  metal.
   *   Case  dielectric  - >     black  material.
       A  black  material  is  a  tracking  medium  for  which
       the  user  has  not  defined  any  optical  property.
       In  this  case  the  photon  is  immediately  absorbed
       undetected.


</PRE>


<H2>Photon  polarisation</H2>


<PRE>


The  photon  polarisation  is  defined  as  a  two
component  vector  normal  to  the  direction  of  the



photon:



                             iphi                                             iphi
                        a   e          1                phi              a   e          c

                   (     1   iphi                  ) = e         o  (     1   -iphi                   )

                        a   e          2                                 a   e           c
                         2                                                2


where  phi         = (phi         - phi        )/ 2  is  called  circularity
               c               1            2

and  phi         = (phi         + phi        )/ 2  is  called  overall  phase.
             o               1            2

Circularity  gives  the  left-  or
right-polarisation  characteristic  of  the  photon.
RICH  materials  usually  do  not  distinguish  between
the  two  polarisations  and  photons  produced  by  the
Cerenkov  effect  are  linearly  polarised,  that  is

phi          = 0.  The  circularity  of  the  photon  is  ignored
         c

by  GEANT.


The  overall  phase  is  important  in  determining
interference  effects  between  coherent  waves.
These  are  important  only  in  layers  of  thickness
comparable  with  the  wavelength,  such  as
interference  filters  on  mirrors.  The  effects  of
such  coatings  can  be  accounted  for  by  the
empirical  reflectivity  factor  for  the  surface,
and  do  not  require  a  microscopic  simulation.
GEANT  does  not  keep  track  of  the  overall  phase.


Vector  polarisation  is  described  by  the
polarisation  angle  tan      psi      = a   / a   .
                                          2     1

Reflection/transmission  probabilities  are
sensitive  to  the  state  of  linear  polarisation,  so
this  has  to  be  taken  into  account.  One  parameter
is  sufficient  to  describe  vector  polarisation,
but  to  avoid  too  many  trigonometrical
transformations,  a  unit  vector  perpendicular  to
the  direction  of  the  photon  is  used  in  GEANT.


The  polarisation  vectors  are  stored  in  a  special
track  structure  which  is  lifted  at  the  link
LQ(JSTACK-1)  when  the  first  Cerenkov  photon  is
stored  in  the  stack.

<H3>Generation  of  the  photons</H3>


<PRE>


For  the  formulas  contained  in  this  chapter,
please  see  .  Let  n  be  the  refractive  index  of  the
dielectric  material  acting  as  a  radiator  (n = c/ c'
where  c'  is  the  group  velocity  of  light  in  the
material:  it  follows  that  1< =    n).  In  a  dispersive
material  n  is  an  increasing  function  of  the
photon  momentum  p               , dn/ dp> =    0.  A  particle
                   gamma

travelling  with  speed  beta        = v/ c  will  emit  photons
at  an  angle  theta           with  respect  to  its  direction,
where  theta           is  given  by  the  relation:



                                  cos      theta          = ((1)/ (beta       n))



from  which  follows  the  limitation  for  the
momentum  of  the  emitted  photons:



                                     min
                                  n(p               ) = ((1)/ (beta       ))

                                     gamma



Additionally,  the  photons  must  be  within  the
window  of  transparency  of  the  radiator.  All  the
photons  will  be  contained  in  a  cone  of  opening

                                                     max
cos      theta                   = 1/ (beta       n(p               )).
                       max
                                                     gamma



The  average  number  of  photons  produced  is  given
by  the  relations  (Gaussian  units):

 The  number  of  photons  produced  is  calculated  from
 a  Poissonian  distribution  with  average  value
 n   = STEP        dN/ dx.  The  momentum  distribution  of  the
 photon  is  then  sampled  from  the  density  function:



                                               2                               2

 <H3>Tracking  of  the  photons</H3>


 <PRE>


 Cerenkov  photons  are  tracked  in  the  routine

 GTCKOV.  These  particles  are  subject  to  in  flight
 absorption  (process  LABS,  number  101)  and
 boundary  action  (process  LREF,  number  102,  see
 above).  As  explained  above,  the  status  of  the
 photon  is  defined  by  2  vectors,  the  photon
 momentum  ("p  =h    "k )  and  photon  polarisation  ("e ).  By
 convention  the  direction  of  the  polarisation
 vector  is  that  of  the  electric  field.  Let  also  "u
 be  the  normal  to  the  material  boundary  at  the
 point  of  intersection,  pointing  out  of  the
 material  which  the  photon  is  leaving  and  toward
 the  one  which  the  photon  is  entering.  The
 behaviour  of  a  photon  at  the  surface  boundary  is
 determined  by  three  quantities:


1.      refraction  or  reflection  angle,  this
        represents  the  kinematics  of  the  effect;
2.      amplitude  of  the  reflected  and  refracted
        waves,  this  is  the  dynamics  of  the  effect;
3.      probability  of  the  photon  to  be  refracted  or
        reflected,  this  is  the  quantum  mechanical
        effect  which  we  have  to  take  into  account  if  we
        want  to  describe  the  photon  as  a  particle  and
        not  as  a  wave;


 As  said  above,  we  distinguish  three  kinds  of



boundary  action,  dielectric  - >     black  material,
dielectric  - >     metal,  dielectric  - >     dielectric.
The  first  case  is  trivial,  in  the  sense  that  the
photon  is  immediately  absorbed  and  it  goes
undetected.


To  determine  the  behaviour  of  the  photon  at  the
boundary,  we  will  at  first  treat  it  as  an
homogeneous  monochromatic  plane  wave:



                                                     i"k "x -iomega         t
                          "E        =         "E    e

                                                0



                                              p  ==========================
                          "B        =            mu    epsilon            (("k  x "E )/ (k))



</PRE>


<H4>Case  dielectric  - >     dielectric</H4>


<PRE>


In  the  classical  description  the  incoming  wave
splits  into  a  reflected  wave  (quantities  with  a
double  prime)  and  a  refracted  wave  (quantities
with  a  single  prime).  Our  problem  is  solved  if  we
find  the  following  quantities:



                                                              ik'"   "x -iomega         t
                             E'"          =         E"'      e

                                                          0



                                                                 ik''"     "x -iomega         t
                           E'"'           =         E''"        e

                                                            0



For  the  wave  numbers  the  following  relations
hold:



                                                                       p  ==========================

          _"k _           =        _"k ''_= k = ((omega         )/ (c))   mu    epsilon



                                                               p  ===============================

       _"k '_             =        k' = ((omega         )/ (c))   mu    'epsilon             '



 Where  the  speed  of  the  wave  in  the  medium  is

        p  ==========================

 v = c/    mu    epsilon              and  the  quantity

            p  ==========================

 n = c/ v =    mu    epsilon              is  called  refractive  index  of
 the  medium.  The  condition  that  the  three  waves,
 refracted,  reflected  and  incident  have  the  same
 phase  at  the  surface  of  the  medium,  gives  us  the
 well  known  Fresnel  law:



            ("k   "x )                        =         ("k '  "x )             = ("k ''  "x )
                      surf                                         surf                       surf



                        k sin      i          =         k' sin      r = k'' sin      r'



 where  i, r, r'  are,  respectively,  the  angle  of  the
 incident,  refracted  and  reflected  ray  with  the
 normal  to  the  surface.  From  this  formula  the  well

 The  dynamic  properties  of  the  wave  at  the
 boundary  are  derived  from  Maxwell's  equations
 which  impose  the  continuity  of  the  normal
 components  of  "D   and  "B   and  of  the  tangential
 components  of  "E   and  "H   at  the  surface  boundary.  The
 resulting  ratios  between  the  amplitudes  of  the
 the  generated  waves  with  respect  to  the  incoming
 one  are  expressed  in  the  two  following  cases:


1.      a  plane  wave  with  the  electric  field
        (polarisation  vector)  perpendicular  to  the
        plane  defined  by  the  photon  direction  and  the
        normal  to  the  boundary:



           ((E   ')/ (E   ))                         =         ((2n cos      i)/ (n cos      i + ((mu    )/ (mu    '))n' cos      r*

 * ((mu    )/ (mu    '))@
           0         0


        where  we  suppose,  as  it  is  legitimate  for
        visible  or  near-visible  light,  that  mu    / mu   ' ss 1;



2.      a  plane  wave  with  the  electric  field  parallel
        to  the  above  surface:



           ((E   ')/ (E   ))                         =         ((2n cos      i)/ (((mu    )/ (mu    '))n' cos      i + n cos      r*

           0         0


        whith  the  same  approximation  as  above.


 We  note  that  in  case  of  photon  perpendicular  to
 the  surface,  the  following  relations  hold:



     ((E   ')/ (E   ))                         =         ((2n)/ (n' + n))                                                          *

 where  the  sign  convention  for  the  parallel  field
 has  been  adopted.  This  means  that  if  n'>n  there  is
 a  phase  inversion  for  the  reflected  wave.


 Any  incoming  wave  can  be  separated  into  one  piece
 polarised  parallel  to  the  plane  and  one  polarised
 perpendicular,  and  the  two  components  treated
 accordingly.


 To  mantain  the  particle  description  of  the
 photon,  the  probability  to  have  a  refracted
 (mechanism  107)  or  reflected  (mechanism  106)
 photon  must  be  calculated.  The  constraint  is  that
 the  number  of  photons  be  conserved,  and  this  can
 be  imposed  via  the  conservation  of  the  energy
 flux  at  the  boundary,  as  the  number  of  photons  is
 proportional  to  the  energy.  The  energy  current  is
 given  by  the  expression:



                                               p  ==========================       *                      p  ======================*

                                                                                                                                   *

 and  the  energy  balance  on  a  unit  area  of  the
 boundary  requires  that:



                                                                        "S   "u          =         "S '  "u - "S ''  "u

If  we  set  again  mu    / mu   ' ss 1,  then  the  transmission
probability  for  the  photon  will  be:



                                     2
              T = (((E   ')/ (E   )))   ((n' cos      r)/ (n cos      i))
                      0        0



and  the  corresponding  probability  to  be  reflected
will  be  R = 1- T.


In  case  of  reflection  the  relation  between  the
incoming  photon  ("k , "e ),  the  refracted  one  ("k ', "e ')
and  the  reflected  one  ("k '', "e '')  is  given  by  the
following  relations:



                    "q        =         "k  x "u


              e               =         (("e   "u )/ (_q_))
               __



                 e            =         (("e   "q )/ (_q_))
                  ?



            e      '          =         e      ((2n cos      i)/ (n' cos      i + n cos      r))
             __                          __



              e   '           =         e   ((2n cos      i)/ (n cos      i + n' cos      r))
               ?                         ?



         e      ''            =         ((n')/ (n))e      '- e
          __                                        __        __



            e   ''            =         e   '- e
             ?                           ?      ?



After  transmission  or  reflection  of  the  photon,
the  polarisation  vector  is  renormalised  to  1.  In
the  case  where  sin      r = n sin      i/ n'>1  then  there
cannot  be  a  refracted  wave,  and  in  this  case  we
have  a  total  internal  reflection  according  to  the
following  formulas:



                                      "k ''           =         "k - 2("k   "u )"u



                                      "e ''           =         - "e + 2("e   "u )"u



</PRE>


<H4>Case  dielectric  - >     metal</H4>


<PRE>


In  this  case  the  photon  cannot  be  transmitted.  So
the  probability  for  the  photon  to  be  absorbed  by
the  metal  is  estimated  according  to  the  table
provided  by  the  user.  If  the  photon  is  not
absorbed,  it  is  reflected.

<H3>Surface  effects</H3>


<PRE>


In  the  case  where  the  surface  between  two  bodies
is  perfectly  polished,  then  the  normal  provided
by  the  program  is  the  normal  to  the  surface
defined  by  the  body  boundary.  This  is  indicated
by  the  the  value  POLISH= 1  as  returned  by  the
GUPLSH  function.  When  the  value  returned  is  <1,
then  a  random  point  is  generated  in  a  sphere  of
radius  1-POLISH,  and  the  corresponding  vector  is
added  to  the  normal.  This  new  normal  is  accepted
if  the  reflected  wave  is  still  inside  the
original  volume.

This  routine  simulates  the  surface  profile
between  two  media  as  seen  by  an  approaching
particle  with  coordinate  and  direction  given  by



X0.  The  surface  is  identified  by  the  arguments
MEDI0  and  MEDI1  which  are  the  tracking  medium
indices  of  the  region  in  which  the  track  is
presently  and  the  one  which  it  approaches,
respectively.  The  input  vector  X1  contains  the
coordinates  of  a  point  on  the  other  side  of  the
boundary  from  X0  and  lying  in  within  medium
MEDI1.  The  result  is  a  unit  vector  U  normal  to  the
surface  of  reflection  at  X0  and  pointing  into  the
medium  from  which  the  track  is  approaching.


The  quality  of  the  surface  finish  is  given  by  the
parameter  returned  by  the  user  function  GUPLSH
(see  below).



       VALUE    =    GUPLSH                            (MEDI0,  MEDI1)



This  function  must  be  supplied  by  the  user.  It
returns  a  value  between  0  and  1  which  decsribes
the  quality  of  the  surface  finish  between  MEDI0
and  MEDI1.  The  value  0  means  maximum  roughness
with  effective  plane  of  reflection  distributed  as
cos      alpha           where  alpha           is  the  angle  between  the
unit  normal  to  the  effective  plane  of  reflection
and  the  normal  to  the  nominal  medium  boundary  at
X0.  The  value  1  means  perfect  smoothness.  In
between  the  surface  is  modelled  as  a  bell-shaped
distribution  in  alpha           with  limits  given  by:


                                     sin      alpha          = (1- GUPLSH           )



At  the  interface  between  two  media  the  routine  is
called  to  evaluate  the  surface.  The  default
version  in  GEANT  returns  1,  i.e.  a  perfectly
polished  surface  is  assumed.  When  GUPLSH  =  0  the
distribution  of  the  normal  to  the  surface  is
ss cos      theta         .

                               tracked.


This  routines  takes  the  Cerenkov  photon  IPHO
generated  during  the  current  step  and  stores  it
in  the  stack  for  subsequent  tracking.  This
routine  performs  for  Cerenkov  photons  the  same
function  that  the  GSKING  routine  performs  for  all
the  other  particles.  The  generated  photons  are
stored  in  the  common  /GCKIN2/  ([BASE030]).

The  user  routine  GUSTEP  is  called  at  every  step  of
tracking.  When  ISTOP  =  2  the  photon  has  been
absorbed.  If  DESTEP  6= 0  then  the  photon  has  been
detected.



       CALL  GGPERP                         (X,  U,  IERR)



X                              (REAL)  array  of  dimension  3
                               containing  the  current  position  of
                               the  track  in  the  MARS;
U                              (REAL)  array  of  dimension  3
                               containing  on  exit  the  normal  to  the
                               surface  of  the  current  volume  at  the
                               point  X;
IERR                           (INTEGER)  error  flag:  if  IERR  6= 0
                               GGPERP  failed  to  find  the  normal  to
                               the  surface  of  the  current  volume.


This  routine  solves  the  general  problem  of
calculating  the  unit  vector  normal  to  the  surface
of  the  current  volume  at  the  point  X.  The  result
is  returned  in  the  array  U.  X  is  assumed  to  be
outside  the  current  volume  and  near  a  boundary
(within  EPSIL).  The  current  volume  is  indicated



by  the  common  /GCVOLU/.  U  points  from  inside  to
outside  in  that  neighbourhood.  If  X  is  within
EPSIL  of  more  than  one  boundary  (i.e.  in  a  corner)
an  arbitrary  choice  is  made.  If  X  is  inside  the
current  volume  or  if  the  current  volume  is  not
handled  by  the  routine,  the  routine  returns  with
IERR=1,  otherwise  IERR=0.  At  the  moment  the
routine  only  handles  BOXes,  TUBEs,  SPHEres  and
CONEs.

<H2>Processes  involving  Cerenkov  photons</H2>


<PRE>


The  process  of  generating  a  Cerenkov  photon  is
called  CKOV  and  corresponds  to  the  process  value
105  (variable  LMEC  in  common  /GCTRAK/).  This
process  is  activated  only  in  a  radiator  defined
via  the  routine  GSCKOV.


The  process  of  photon  absorption  (name  LABS,  code
101)  is  controlled  by  the  LABS  FFREAD  data
record.  By  default  the  process  is  activated  for
all  the  materials  for  which  optical  properties
have  been  defined.


The  action  taken  at  the  boundary  is  identified  by
the  process  name  LREF,  code  102.


At  a  boundary  a  photon  can  be  either  reflected
(name  REFL,  code  106)  or  refracted  (name  REFR,
code  107).
