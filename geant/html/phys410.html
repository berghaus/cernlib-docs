       CALL  GLOREN                         (BETA,PA,PB*)



GLOREN  transforms  the  momentum  and  the  energy
from  one  Lorentz  frame  (A)  to  another  (B).  It  uses
the  following  input  and  output:


BETA(4)                   (REAL)  velocity  components  in  light
                          units  of  frame  B  in  frame  A,  BETA(1. . .     3)

                                                                  2   -1/2
                          = beta"      ,  BETA(4)= (1- beta          )             = gamma         ;
PA(4)                     (REAL)  momentum  components  in  the  frame
                          (A);
PB(4)                     (REAL)  momentum  components  in  the  frame
                          (B).


GLOREN  is  called  from  the  routine  GDECAY.  The
momentum  "p      and  energy  E     in  reference  frame  A  are
            A                   A

transformed  into  the  momentum  "p      and  energy  E     in
                                    B                   B

reference  frame  B  which  translates  with  velocity
beta"        with  respect  to  A:


E            =         gamma         (E   - beta"        "p    )
 B                                     A                   A



"p           =         "p     + gamma         beta"      (((gamma         beta "       "p    )/ (gamma          + 1))- E   )
  B                      A                                                               A                              A



       CALL  GDROT                       (P*,COSTH,SINTH,COSPH,SINPH)



GDROT  rotates  a  vector  from  one  reference  system
to  another.


P(3)                      (REAL)  vector  to  rotate,  overwritten  on
                          output;
COSTH                     (REAL)  cosine  of  the  polar  angle;
SINTH                     (REAL)  sine  of  the  polar  angle;
COSPH                     (REAL)  cosine  of  the  azimuthal  angle;
SINPH                     (REAL)  sine  of  the  azimuthal  angle;


GDROT  is  called  from  several  routines  to  rotate  a
particle  from  in  the  center-of-mass  system  to  the
GEANT  (laboratory)  system.  The  following
rotation  matrix  is  used:



     cos      theta         cos      phi             - sin      phi             sin      theta          cos      phi               *
 *   cos      phi      @


(    cos      theta         sin      phi              cos      phi              sin      theta          sin      phi         ) = ( *
 *   sin      phi      @



            - sin      theta                                  0                          cos      theta                            *
 *          0          @

                                                                                                                                 _=*

R                is  a  counterclockwise  rotation  around  axis
 theta

y  by  an  angle  theta         ,  and  R           is  a
                                         phi

counterclockwise  rotation  around  axis  z'
(rotated  by  an  angle  theta           from  the  initial
position)  by  an  angle  phi     .



       CALL  GFANG                       (P,COSTH*,SINTH*,COSPH*,SINPH*,ROTATE*)



P(3)                      (REAL)  input  direction;
COSTH                     (REAL)  cosine  of  the  polar  angle;
SINTH                     (REAL)  sine  of  the  polar  angle;
COSPH                     (REAL)  cosine  of  the  azimuthal  angle;
SINPH                     (REAL)  sine  of  the  azimuthal  angle;
ROTATE                    (LOGICAL)  rotation  flag,  the  rotation
                          matrix  is  the  unit  matrix  if
                          ROTATE=.FALSE.,  i.e.  no  rotation  is
                          needed;


Find  the  sine  and  cosine  of  the  polar  and
azimuthal  angle  of  the  direction  defined  by  the
vector  P.  If  P  is  along  the  z  axis,
ROTATE=.FALSE..



       CALL  GVROT                       (DCOSIN,PART*)



PART(3)                   (REAL)  direction  to  be  rotated,
                          overwritten  on  output;
DCOSIN(3)                 (REAL)  direction  of  the  new  z  axis;


Given  the  direction  PART  in  a  system  of  reference
O,  it  returns  the  same  direction  in  the  system  of
reference  where  the  z  axis  of  O  is  along  DCOSIN.
This  routine  is  very  useful  when  the  theta           angle
of  a  secondary  particle  is  sampled  in  a  reference
frame  where  the  parent  particle  moves  along  the  z
axis.  Then  the  direction  of  the  secondary  product
in  the  MRS  is  returned  by  GVROT  if  DCOSIN  is  the
direction  of  the  parent  particle.


A  call  to  GVROT  is  equivalent  to  the  following
code:
           DIMENSION  PART(3),  DCOSIN(3)
           LOGICAL  ROTATE
           .
           .
           .
           CALL  GFANG(DCOSIN,COSTH,SINTH,COSPH,SINPH,ROTATE)
           IF(ROTATE)  CALL  GDROT(PART,COSTH,SINTH,COSPH,SINPH)


with  the  advantage  that  inside  GVROT  all
calculations  are  performed  in  double  precision.
