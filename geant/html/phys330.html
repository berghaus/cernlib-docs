       CALL  GDRELA



GDRELA  initialises  the  ionisation  energy  loss
tables  for  different  materials  for  muons,
electrons  and  positrons  and  other  particles.  The
energy  binning  is  set  within  the  array  ELOW
(common  /GCMULO/)  in  the  routine  GPHYSI.  The
tables  are  filled  with  the  quantity  dE/ dx  in
GeV/cm  (formula  (??    )  below)  which  is  valid  for  an
element  as  well  as  a  mixture  or  a  compound.  In  the
tables  the  dE/dx  due  to  ionisation  is  summed  with
the  energy  loss  coming  from  bremsstrahlung.  For
energy  loss  of  electrons  and  positrons,  it  calls
GDRELE  using  the  following  pointers:



                                                                            th

    JEL1  =  LQ(JMA-1)                                   pointer  for  dE/dx  for  electrons

GDRELA  is  called  at  initialisation  time  by
GPHYSI.



       CALL  GDRELE                         (EEL,CHARGE,JMA,DEDX)



GDRELE  computes  the  ionisation  energy  loss  (DEDX)



for  electrons  (CHARGE  =  -1)  and  positrons  (CHARGE
=  +1)  with  kinetic  energy  EEL  in  the  material
indicated  by  I  in  JMA  =  LQ(JMATE-I).  It  is  called
by  the  routine  GDRELA.



       CALL  GDRSGA



CDRSGA  calculates  the  total  cross-section  in  all
materials  for  delta  rays  for oM"ller  (e-e-)  and
Bhabha  (e-e+)  scattering  and  for  muons.  It
tabulates  the  mean  free  path,  lambda            = 1/ Sigma           (in
cm)  as  a  function  of  the  medium  and  the  energy.
The  energy  binning  is  set  within  the  array  ELOW
(common  /GCMULO/)  in  the  routine  GPHYSI.  The
following  pointers  are  used  (see  JMATE  data
structure):

Let:
                                      ((dsigma         (E, T))/ (dT))

be  the  differential  cross-section  for  the
ejection  of  an  electron  with  kinetic  energy  T  by


an  incident  e       of  total  energy  E  moving  in  a
medium  of  density  rho     .


The  variable  DCUTE  in  common  /GCCUTS/  is  the
kinetic  energy  cut-off  for  the  generated
delta         -rays.  Below  this  threshold  the  soft
electrons  ejected  are  simulated  as  continuous




energy  loss  by  the  incident  e     ,  and  above  it  they
are  explicitly  generated.


The  mean  value  of  the  energy  lost  by  the  incident


e       to  the  soft  delta         -rays  is:


                                        DCUTE
  E            (E, DCUTE         ) = R                ((dsigma         (E, T))/ (dT))T dT

whereas  the  total  cross-section  for  the  ejection
of  an  electron  of  energy  T>DCUTE           is:


                                           T

where  T           is  the  maximum  energy  transferable  to
        Max

the  free  electron:



                                              E- m                        for        e +

                             Max              (E- m)/ 2                   for        e- ,



where  m  is  the  electron  mass.  The  method  of
calculation  of  the  continuous  energy  loss  and  the
total  cross-section  are  explained  below.
[PHYS331]  deals  with  the  explicit  simulation  of
the  delta         -rays.
