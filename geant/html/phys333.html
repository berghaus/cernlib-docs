<H2>Method</H2>


<PRE>


When  a  charged  particle  traverses  a  portion  of
matter,  it  interacts  with  the  electrons  and  the
nuclei  of  the  atoms.  Most  of  these  interactions
are  electromagnetic  (quasi-)  elastic  collisions
in  which  the  incoming  particle  loses  energy  in
the  laboratory  reference  frame.  The  amount  of
energy  loss  in  a  thickness  of  material  t  is
subject  to  two  sources  of  fluctuations.  The
number  of  collisions  can  fluctuate,  and  at  the
same  time  the  energy  lost  in  each  collision
varies  statistically.  Both  distributions  are
characterised  by  a  Poissonian-like  behaviour.  We
can  distinguish  between  collisions  where  the
energy  transferred  to  the  atomic  electrons  is
enough  to  extract  them  from  the  atoms  (ionisation
with  production  of  delta         -rays)  and  collisions
where  the  atomic  structure  is  excited,  without  a
complete  ionisation  (excitation).  It  has  to  be
noted  that  the  energy  transferred  to  the  nuclei
is  usually  negligible.  Momentum  conservation
considerations  show  that  the  ratio  of  the  energy
transferred  to  electrons  to  the  energy
transferred  to  nucleus  in  Coulomb  interactions  is

                          -1     -1
of  the  order  of  m   ZA      m      .

Several  theories  have  been  proposed  to  describe
this  important  mechanism  in  the  transport  of
charged  particles.  The  main  difference  of  these
theories  is  in  the  greater  or  lesser  detail  with
which  the  scattering  centres  are  described.  The
detail  of  these  theories  as  they  are  implemented
in  GEANT  can  be  found  in  [PHYS332],  [PHYS334]  for
energy  loss  fluctuations  and  in  [PHYS430],
[PHYS431]  for  energy  loss.


In  general,  the  greater  the  thickness  of  the



 layer  traversed  in  terms  of  the  number  of  atoms
 encountered,  the  larger  is  the  number  of
 collisions.  In  this  case  a  detailed  description
 of  the  atomic  structure  may  be  irrelevant  to
 account  for  the  form  of  the  fluctuation.  Landau
 and  Vavilov  have  proposed  theories  in  this  region
 and  these  are  implemented  in  GEANT.


 When  the  thickness  of  the  material  is  such  that
 the  number  of  collisions  becomes  smaller,  the
 detailed  nature  of  the  atomic  structure  becomes
 important  in  determining  the  fluctuations  of  the
 energy  loss.  In  this  case  the  coupling  of  the
 various  atomic  energy  levels  to  the  to  the
 Coulomb  field  must  be  taken  into  account.


 When  simulating  the  energy  loss  by  ionisation,
 the  average  path-length  between  collisions  is  a
 function  of  the  cross  section  sigma         (E).  This
 cross  section  becomes  very  large  when  E- >   0,  so
 that  it  is  necessary  to  establish  a  threshold
 energy  below  which  the  process  is  described  in  a
 condensed  way.  Above  this  threshold,  ionisations
 are  described  in  a  detailed  way,  with  the
 production  of  delta         -rays.  Thus,  when  a  charged
 particle  is  moving  in  a  medium,  there  are  in
 general  two  ways  to  simulate  the  energy  loss  by
 ionisation:


1.      calculate  the  average  value  the  energy  loss  via
        the  full  Bethe-Bloch  equation.  This  takes  into
        account  delta         -rays  generation.  The
        fluctuations  are  then  explicitly  introduced
        via  an  appropriate  distribution.  In  GEANT  this
        method  is  selected  by  the  value  ILOSS  =  2  which
        is  controlled  by  the  LOSS  data  record.
2.      explicitly  generate  the  delta         -rays  above  a
        given  threshold  (DCUTE  for  electrons,  DCUTM
        for  others  particle).  In  this  case  the  average
        energy  loss  is  computed  from  a  restricted
        formula  and  both  the  value  of  the  energy  loss
        and  the  number  of  delta         -rays  produced  are
        function  of  the  threshold  cut  (hereafter
        DRCUT).  In  GEANT  this  method  is  selected  by  the
        value  ILOSS  =  1  which  is  controlled  by  the  LOSS
        data  record.

 <H3>Validity  ranges  for  the  different
 models</H3>


 <PRE>


 The  limits  of  the  validity  for  the  various  models
 are  somewhat  arbitrary  within  a  certain  range  of



material  densities  and  particle  energies.  To  help
determine  these  limits,  some  characteristic
parameters  are  used:

In  GEANT  two  variables  control  the  model  used  to

                               0                no  energy  loss;



                                1                delta         -rays  are  produced  above

                                                 below  the  threshold  are  added

                                                 available)  PAI  model  otherwise;


 The  validity  limits  of  the  different  models  are
 estimated  as  follows:


1.      large  number  of  low-energy  collisions:
        Delta         > =    50
        if  delta         -rays  generation  is  requested  (ILOSS  =
        1  or  3  and  IDRAY  =  1)  the  Urban  model  is  used.
        If  delta         -rays  are  not  produced  (ILOSS  =  2  and
        IDRAY  =  0)  we  distinguish  three  regions:
            (a)        very  few  energy  transfers  close  to  the

                                                       -2
                       maximum:  kappa         < =   10
                       the  Landau  distribution  is  used;
            (b)        few  energy  transfers  close  to  the

                                   -2
                       maximum:  10      <kappa         < =    10
                       the  Vavilov  distribution  is  used;
            (c)        many  energy  transfers  close  to  the
                       maximum:  kappa         >10
                       the  Gauss  distribution  is  used;
2.      small  number  of  low-energy  collisions:
        Delta         <50
        in  this  region  the  same  model  is  used  for
        1< =    ILOSS         < =   3  irrespective  of  the  value  of
        IDRAY.  The  model  used  depends  on  the  value  of
        ISTRA.
            (a)        30<Delta         < =    50
                       Urban  model  if  ISTRA  = 0,  PAI  model
                       otherwise.
            (b)        1<Delta         < =    30
                       Urban  model  if  ISTRA  = 0,  PAI  model  if
                       ISTRA  = 1  and  ASHO  model  if  ISTRA  = 2.
            (c)        0. 01<Delta         < =    1

The  full  energy  loss  fluctuations  or  the
restricted  fluctuations  complemented  by  the
production  of  delta         -rays  give  equivalent  results
if  the  number  of  delta         -rays  generated  is
sufficient,  e.g.  a  few  tens  along  the  full
trajectory  of  the  particle  in  the  medium.


For  a  relativistic  particle,  the  number  of
delta-rays  produced  per  cm  can  be  estimated
integrating  the  cross  section  provided  in  :


                                                2
((dN)/ (dx)) ss ((D)/ (2))((rho      Z)/ (A))((Z         )/ (DRCUT         ))

DRCUT                  energy  threshold  for  emitted  delta-rays.


This  formula  holds  for  electrons/positrons  as
well  as  for  other  particles.  The  number  of
delta         -rays  must  be  sufficient  to  reproduce  the
statistical  fluctuations  in  the  energy  loss,  but
not  too  large,  as  in  this  case  a  large  amount  of
time  could  be  spent  in  tracking  them  without  a
corresponding  improvement  of  the  energy  loss
distribution.


On  the  other  hand,  the  distribution  of  the  energy
lost  by  a  particle  does  not  necessarily
correspond  to  the  distribution  of  the  energy
deposited  by  the  same  particle  in  the  medium
traversed.  This  is  particularly  true  for  light  or
thin  materials  where  delta         -rays  can  escape  into
the  next  material.


It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  to  estimate
the  number  of  delta         -rays  per  cm  that  are  needed,



according  to  the  considerations  above.  Then  the
correct  value  for  DRCUT  should  be  set  with  the
help  of  GDRPRT.  It  is  recommended  to  use  the  same
value  for  DCUTE  and  DCUTM.  As  the  GEANT  tables  for
cross-sections  are  not  generated  below  EKMIN,
DRCUT  cannot  be  smaller  than  EKMIN.  The  value  of
EKMIN  can  be  changed  via  the  ERAN  data  record,  and
its  default  value  is  10  keV.


In  a  light  material  like  gas,  the  number  of
emitted  delta         -rays  for  DRCUT  = 10  keV  may  not  be
sufficient  to  ensure  a  correct  energy  loss
distribution.  If  the  user  is  mainly  interested  in
the  energy  lost  by  the  particle,  no  discrete
delta         -ray  should  be  produced  setting  ILOSS  = 2
(see  [PHYS332]).


In  case  the  user  is  more  interested  in  a  precise
simulation  of  the  energy  deposited,  then  the
explicit  delta         -ray  generation  should  be  tried.


As  far  as  thin  materials  are  concerned
(Delta         <50),  the  default  in  GEANT  is  to  use  the
Urban  model.  Comparison  with  experimental  data
have  shown  that  this  model  gives  very  good
results,  and  it  is  considerably  faster  than  both
the  ASHO  and  the  PAI  models.  Users  should
understand  well  their  setup  and  their  results
before  they  try  with  different  models,  which,  in
principle,  should  give  very  similar  results.

In  order  to  avoid  double  counting,  there  is  an
automatic  protection  in  the  code:  if  ILOSS=2,
IDRAY  is  set  to  0  and  the  generation  of  delta         -rays
is  disabled.


The  following  table  summarises  the  different
cases:
