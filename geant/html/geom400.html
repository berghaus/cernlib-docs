       CALL  GSORD                       (CHNAME,ICORD)



CHNAME                    (CHARACTER*4)  name  of  the  volume;
ICORD                     (INTEGER)  direction  of  the
                          pseudo-divisions:

                          1             x;
                          2             y;
                          3             z;

                                                         p  ================

                                                             2      2
                          4             cylindrical  R  (   x    + y        );

                                                              p  ==========================

                                                                  2      2      2
                          5             spherical  rho       (   x    + y    + z           );
                          6             phi     ,  azimuthal  angle;
                          7             theta         ,  polar  angle  with  respect  to
                                        the  z  axis.


This  routine  sets  the  search  flag  (Q(JVO+1))  of
volume  CHNAME  to  -ICORD.  When  the  definition  of
the  geometry  is  complete  and  GGCLOS  is  called,
this  flag  is  interpreted  as  a  request  to  order  the
content  of  CHNAME  along  axis  ICORD.  This
operation  is  performed  by  the  routine  GGORD.
GGORD  computes  the  limits  of  each  of  the  contents
along  the  given  coordinate  axis  (see  [GEOM001]),
and  prepares  the  lists  of  contents  in  each  of  the
sections  defined  by  the  neighbouring  coordinate.
The  JVOLUM  structure  is  extended,  for  the  mother
volume,  with  banks  which  contains  the  list  of
boundaries  and  the  lists  of  contents,  so  as  to
permit  a  binary  search  to  access  the  contents  of
interest.  The  coordinates  are  in  the  local  system
of  the  mother  volume.  The  routine  GGORD  will  not
be  called  if  the  number  of  contents  exceeds  500.


The  actual  effect  of  this  routine  depends  on  the
setting  of  the  IOPTIM  variable  in  the  common



/GCOPTI/.  IOPTIM  is  controlled  by  the  data  record
OPTI  or  the  interactive  command  with  the  same
name.  The  meaning  of  the  different  values  of
IOPTIM  is  the  following:


<0            no  call  to  GGORD  will  be  made,  irrespective
              of  the  value  of  ISEARCH;
  0           GGORD  will  be  called  for  those  volumes  for
              which  GSORD  has  been  called;
  1           for  all  volumes  with  contents  for  which
              neither  GUSEAR  nor  GSORD  has  been  called,
              the  routine  GGORDQ  will  be  called;
  2           GGORDQ  is  called  for  all  volumes  with
              contents  for  which  GUSEAR  has  not  been
              called.


GGORDQ  orders  the  contents  along  all  the  possible
axes  and  choses  the  ordering  which  provides  the
lowest  number  of  volumes  per  division.
