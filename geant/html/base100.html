<H2>Notes</H2>


<PRE>


   *   Whenever  possible  GEANT  makes  use  of  the  ZEBRA
       store  for  large  data  structures.  This  allows  it
       to  adapt  the  size  of  the  program  data  portion
       to  the  size  of  the  problem.  The  total  amount  of
       space  required  depends  on  the  application.
       GEANT  can  run  with  as  little  as  50,000  words  or
       less,  but  for  large  detectors  it  is  not
       uncommon  to  declare  stores  of  several  million
       words.  The  call  to  GZEBRA  initialises  the
       common  /GCBANK/  to  receive  the  GEANT  data
       structures.  This  call  is  necessary  before  any
       other  routine  of  the  GEANT  system  is  called.
   *   The  call  to  HLIMIT  initialises  the  ZEBRA  system
       to  use  the  /PAWC/  common  block  for  the  HBOOK
       histogram  package.  The  size  of  the  common
       depends  on  the  number  and  size  of  the  plot



    requested.  The  ZEBRA  system  must  be
    initialised  only  once,  and  the  negative
    argument  to  HLIMIT  prevents  a  second
    initialisation  of  the  system.  The  HLIMIT  call
    has  to  be  placed  after  the  call  to  GZEBRA  and
    the  argument  has  to  be  the  dimension  of  the
    /PAWC/  common  block  with  a  negative  sign  in
    front.
*   The  main  program  is  intended  for  batch
    applications,  while  to  run  the  simulation
    interactively,  the  interactive  main  program
    called  GXINT  should  be  linked  in  front  of  the
    user  code.
*   The  program  shown  will  require  the  graphic
    libraries  in  the  link  sequence.  Often,  for
    batch  production  or  for  small  tests,  graphics
    is  not  needed,  and  not  loading  the  graphics
    code  makes  the  program  smaller.  To  avoid
    loading  graphic  routines  the  calls  to  IGINIT,
    IGMETA,  IGEND,  GDINIT  and  GDEBUG  should  be
    removed.
    If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  user  is  interested
    in  including  the  routine  GDEBUG  and  in
    excluding  graphics  at  the  same  time,  then  the
    following  routine  should  be  included  in  the
    code:
               SUBROUTINE  GDCXYZ
               ENTRY  IGSA
               ENTRY  GDTRAK
               END
    which  will  avoid  every  reference  to  the
    graphics  routines  from  GDEBUG.
*   The  user  code  to  define  the  tracking  media  and
    the  geometry  of  the  setup  should  be  inside  the
    routine  UGEOM.  The  pre-initialised  data
    structured  can  be  read  from  disk,  but  it  is
    recommended  to  call  GPHYSI  in  any  case,  to
    initialise  the  cross-section  tables.  An
    example  of  a  full  material,  geometry  and
    detector  design  is  given  below  and  has  been
    extracted  from  the  example  GEXAM3.  Here  only
    major  calls  are  shown,  the  redundant  parts  can
    be  found  in  the  source  code  of  UGEOM  in  GEXAM3.
    The  example  shows  the  basic  concept  in  GEANT.
    First  material  parameters  are  defining  the
    properities  of  a  detector  material  calling  the
    subroutine  GSMATE.  Here  in  addition  to  the  16
    predefined  materials,  the  material  definition
    of  Calcium  is  examplary  shown.  More
    information  towards  the  predefined  materials
    and  further  use  of  material  definition
    routines  can  be  found  in  the  section  CONS001  -
    CONS101.  Then  tracking  parameters  are
    associated  to  the  materials,  defining  a  so
    called  tracking  medium.  Each  GEANT  volume  must
    be  associated  to  an  existing  tracking  medium.



Here  in  the  example  the  tracking  medium
'TARGET'  is  defined  to  exist  of  Calcium.
In  the  example  shown  below  several  detector
volumes  are  defined  using  the  subroutine
GSVOLU.  The  defined  volume  have  associated
parameters  of  name,  shape,  tracking  medium  and
shape  parameters.  In  this  example  the  volume
'TGT  '  consists  of  the  previously  defined
tracking  medium  'TARGET'.The  volumes  (and  if
necessary  identical  copies  of  them)  are  then
positioned  according  to  the  detector  geometry.
The  volumes  are  positioned  on  the  same  level,
or  inside  each  other.  By  setting  the  parameter
ONLY  or  MANY  in  the  call  of  GSPOS  the  user  has
the  opportunity  to  tell  either  GEANT  the
logical  volume  structure  and  to  apply  boolean
operations  (cutting,  joining  and
intersection)  between  two  positioned  volumes.
More  information  about  the  concept  in  defining
volumes  and  positioning  can  be  retrieved  from
the  section  GEOM.
Finally  the  user  is  required  to  classify  into
sets  all  sensitive  detectors  (defined  as  those
volume  defined  as  detector  via  GSDET  and  other
related  routines,  for  which  he  wants  to  store
hits  in  the  hit  data  structure  JHITS.

               END
*   It  is  convenient  to  store  the  input  data
    records  (see  [BASE040])  in  an  auxiliary  file
    (gcards.dat  in  the  example).  This  allows  to
    have  a  standard  input  file  and  to  overwrite
    selected  input  data  records  as  needed.  If,  for
    instance,  the  standard  gcards.dat  file
    contains  the  record  TRIG  1000  and  a  short  test
    run  is  requested  this  can  be  obtained  with  the
    following  input:
    READ  4
    TRIG  10



    STOP
    the  first  line  instructs  FFREAD  to  open  and
    process  the  file  connected  with  logical  unit  4,
    and  the  second  line  (re-)defines  the  number  of
    events  to  be  processed.  The  STOP  command  ends
    the  FFREAD  processing  of  the  input.
*   In  the  above  example  the  common  blocks  have  not
    been  expanded  in  the  code.  The  notation  used  is
    the  one  of  the  PATCHY/CMZ    code  management
    systems.  These  products,  among  other  things,
    can  run  as  pre-processors,  replacing  the
    +SEQ,...  instructions  with  the  corresponding
    code  fragments.  Users  are  strongly  recommended
    to  use  these  systems  to  include  GEANT  common
    blocks  in  their  code.
    Long  experience  in  supporting  GEANT  users  has
    shown  that,  as  the  user  program  grows,  typing
    errors  in  the  insertion  of  the  common  blocks  by
    hand  become  very  common,  but  difficult  to  find.
    The  investment  needed  to  learn  a  code
    management  system  at  the  user  level  is  usually
    negligible  compared  with  the  time  and  energy
    needed  in  hunting  a  problem  introduced  by  a
    mistyped  common.
