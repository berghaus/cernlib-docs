       CALL  GANNI



GANNI  generates  the  annihilation  of  a  positron
into  either  one  or  two  photons.  It  uses  the
following  input  and  output:


input:                 via  common  /GCTRAK/
output:                via  common  /GCKING/


The  routine  is  called  automatically  from  the
tracking  routine  GTELEC,  when  the  positron
reaches  its  interaction  point  during  the
tracking.



       CALL  GANNIR



GANNIR  generates  the  positron  annihilation  at
rest.  It  is  called  from  the  tracking  routine
GTELEC,  if  the  positron  energy  is  below  the
cut-off  energy  CUTELE  in  common  block  /GCCUTS/.

The  type  of  annihilation  is  sampled  from  the
total  cross-sections  for  the  annihilation  into
two  photons  and  into  one  photon  (see  section
[PHYS350]).

<H4>Annihilation  into  two  photons</H4>

The  differential  cross-section  of  the  two-photon
positron-electron  annihilation  can  be  written  as
:


((dsigma         (Z, epsilon            ))/ (depsilon             )) = ma[S(aepsilon             )+S(a(1- epsilon            ))]
                                                                                                                            (1)
where  m  is  the  electron  mass  Z  is  the  atomic
number  of  the  material.  If  we  indicate  with  E  the
initial  energy  of  the  positron,  with  r     the

classical  electron  radius  and  with  k  the  energy
of  the  less  energetic  photon  generated,  we  have:



    gamma                      =         ((E)/ (m))                                                                                *

    epsilon                    =         ((k)/ (E + m))                                                                            *

The  kinematical  limits  for  the  variable  epsilon
are:


                                   p  ========================

                                                    2

                    0


Due  to  the  symmetry  of  the  formula  (??    )  in
epsilon             ,  the  range  of  epsilon              can  be  expanded
from  (epsilon                , 1/ 2)  to  (epsilon                , 1- epsilon               )
                           0                                    0                          0

and  the  second  function  S  can  be  eliminated  from
the  formula.  Having  done  this,  the  differential
cross-section  can  be  decomposed  (apart  from  the
normalisation)  as:


                                                                                                                                   *

 sampled  by  the  following  steps:


1.      sample  epsilon              from  f(epsilon             ):

        epsilon              = epsilon                exp       [ln    (((1- epsilon               )/ (epsilon                )))r *

                                                   0                                            0                          0      1

                                                                                                                             (3)
2.      compute  the  rejection  function  g(epsilon             )  and
            (a)        if  r   < =    g(epsilon             )  accept  epsilon
                            2

            (b)        if  r   >g(epsilon             )  go  back  to  1.
                            1


 After  the  successful  sampling  of  epsilon             ,  the
 photon  energy  is  computed  as

                                              k = (E + m)epsilon                                                             (4)

 and  then  GANNI  generates  the  polar  angles  of  the
 photon  with  respect  to  an  axis  defined  by  the
 momentum  of  the  positron.  The  azimuthal  angle  Phi
 is  generated  isotropically  and  Theta           is  computed
 from  the  energy-momentum  conservation.  With  this
 information,  the  momentum  vector  of  both  photons
 can  be  calculated  and  transformed  into  the  GEANT
 coordinate  system.


 The  routine  GANNIR  treates  the  special  case  when
 a  positron  falls  below  the  cut-off  energy  (CUTELE
 in  common  block  /GCCUTS/)  before  annihilating.  In
 this  case,  it  is  assumed  that  the  positron  comes
 to  rest  before  annihilating.  GANNIR  generates  two
 photons  with  energy  k = m.  The  angular
 distribution  is  isotropic.

 The  generated  photon  is  assumed  to  be  collinear
 with  the  positron.  Its  energy  will  be

                                                k = E + m   - E                                                              (5)

 where  E              is  the  binding  energy  of  the  K-shell

                                                                           2

 <H2>Restrictions</H2>


 <PRE>


1.      The  annihilation  processes  producing  three  or
        more  photons  are  ignored,  because  these
        processes  are  negligible  compared  to  the
        annihilation  into  two  photons  ;
2.      In  calculating  the  process  it  is  assumed  that
        the  atomic  electron  initially  is  free  and  at
        rest.  This  is  the  usual  assumption  used  in
        shower  programs  ;
