       CALL  GCOMP



GCOMP  generates  the  Compton  scattering  of  a
photon  on  an  atomic  electron.  It  uses  the  random
number  techniques  of  Butcher  and  Messell    to
sample  the  scattered  photon  energy  according  to
the  Klein-Nishina  formula  .


The  interaction  produces  one  electron,  which  is
put  in  the  /GCKING/  common  block  for  further
tracking.  Tracking  of  the  scattered  photon  will
continue,  with  direction  and  energy  changed  by
the  interaction.  All  input/output  information  is
through  GEANT  common  blocks.



    Input:                     via  COMMON  /GCTRACK/



    Output:                    via  COMMONs  /GCTRAK/  and  /GCKING/



Compton  scattering  is  selected  in  GEANT  by  the
input  data  record  COMP.  When  Compton  scattering
is  selected,  GCOMP  is  called  automatically  from
the  GEANT  photon  tracking  routine  GTGAMA.

For  a  complete  account  of  the  Monte  Carlo  methods
used  the  interested  user  is  referred  to  the



publications  of  Butcher  and  Messel  ,  Messel  and
Crawford    and  Ford  and  Nelson  .  Only  the  basic
formalism  is  outlined  here.


The  quantum  mechanical  Klein-Nishina
differential  cross-section  is:

                                 2           2                                                                                     *

Phi      (E, E') = ((X   npi    r   m   )/ (E   ))[((1)/ (epsilon             ))+epsilon             ][1- ((epsilon             sin*
 *         theta       @
                      0              e
                                 0

where,



    E                   =       energy  of  the  incident  photon



    E'                =         energy  of  the  scattered  photon



    epsilon              =      E'/ E



    m                   =       electron  mass
     e


    n                   =       electron  density



    r                   =       classical  electron  radius
     0


    X                   =       radiation  length
     0


Assuming  an  elastic  collision,  the  scattering
angle  theta           is  defined  by  the  Compton  formula:



                       E' = E((m   )/ (m    + E(1- cos      theta         )))
                                e       e



Using  the  combined  ``composition  and  rejection''
Monte  Carlo  methods  described  in  chapter  PHYS211,
we  may  set:

 The  value  of  epsilon              corresponding  to  the  minimum
 photon  energy  (backward  scattering)  is  given  by:


                         epsilon                       =         ((1)/ (1 + 2E/ m   ))
                                             0                                   e



 Given  a  set  of  random  numbers  r     uniformly
                                      i

 distributed  in  [0,1],  the  sampling  procedure  for
 epsilon               is  the  following:


1.      decide  which  element  of  the  f(epsilon             )
        distribution  to  sample  from.  Let
        alpha             = (alpha             + alpha            )r   .  If  alpha            > =    alpha
                      T                    1                   2    0                       1                       T

        select  f   (epsilon             ),  otherwise  select
                 1

        f   (epsilon             );
         2

2.      sample  epsilon              from  the  distributions
        corresponding  to  f     or  f   .  For  f     this  is
                            1         2           1

        simply  achieved  by:


                                                                                  alpha
                                    epsilon             = epsilon                e               r
                                                                              0                   1
                                                                                  1


        For  f   ,  we  change  variables  and  use:
              2



                                     max     (r   , r   )                for              E/ m> =    (E/ m + 1)r

        epsilon             ' = -              2     3                                                          4                  *
 *      .

                                     r                                   for  all  other  cases
                                      5


        Then,
        epsilon              = epsilon                + (1- epsilon               )epsilon             ';
                                                   0                           0

                           2
3.      calculate  sin         theta          = max     (0, t(2- t))  where
        t = m   (1- epsilon            )/ E'
             e

4.      test  the  rejection  function,  if
        r   < =    g(epsilon             )  accept  epsilon             ,  otherwise
         6

        return  to  step  1.


 After  the  successful  sampling  of  epsilon             ,  GCOMP
 generates  the  polar  angles  of  the  scattered
 photon  with  respect  to  the  direction  of  the



parent  photon.  The  azimuthal  angle,  phi     ,  is
generated  isotropically  and  theta           is  as  defined
above.  The  momentum  vector  of  the  scattered
photon  is  then  calculated  according  to  kinematic
considerations.  Both  vectors  are  then
transformed  into  the  GEANT  coordinate  system.

The  differential  cross-section  is  only  valid  for
those  collisions  in  which  the  energy  of  the
recoil  electron  is  large  compared  with  its
binding  energy  (which  is  ignored).  However,  as
pointed  out  by  Rossi  ,  this  has  a  negligible
effect  because  of  the  small  number  of  recoil
electrons  produced  at  very  low  energies.
