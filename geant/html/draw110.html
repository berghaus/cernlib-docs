       CALL  GDRAW                       (CHNAME,THETA,PHI,PSI,U0,V0,SU,SV)



Draws  an  orthographic  parallel  projection  or  a
perspective  projection  of  volume  CHNAME
according  to  the  options  set  via  the  routine
GDOPT  and  all  its  visible  descendants  (see
routine  GSATT  to  alter  the  visibility  of  a
volume)  at  position  U0,V0  (user  coordinates),
with  the  scale  factors  SU  and  SV;  the  object  is
seen  from  THETA  and  PHI  angles,  and  the  resulting
2D  projection  is  rotated  by  an  angle  PSI  on  the
screen  plane.  These  parameters,  as  well  as  zoom
parameters  set  by  GDZOOM  define  the  current  view
parameters,  and  they  are  copied  in  the  common
/GCDRAW/.  Attributes  like  colour,  surface  fill,
line  width,  line  style,  visibility,  etc.  can  be
set  by  calling  the  GSATT  routine  for  CHNAME  and
its  descendants  [GEOM  500].  An  example  of  the
result  of  the  call:


 CALL  GDRAW('ARM  ',40.,40.,0.,nx,ny,0.015,0.015)


is  given  in  fig  ??     for  various  values  of  the
attributes  and  graphic  options.

Drawing  with  hidden  line  removal  and  surface  fill
shading  is  also  possible,  but  the  drawing  time
may  increase  substantially  for  complicated
objects.


When  using  the  interactive  interface  it  is
possible  to  cut  the  object  to  be  drawn  with
cutting  volumes  (command  CVOL).  This  is
particularly  useful  to  visualise  the  contents  of
an  object  drawn  with  hidden  line  removal.  Another



feature  which  is  available  only  interactively  is
the  possibility  to  draw  each  decendant  of  a
volume  shifted  along  the  axis  which  goes  from  the
centre  of  the  local  coordinate  system  to  the
centre  of  gravity  of  the  descendant  itself.  This
again  is  useful  to  improve  the  visibility  of  the
details  of  a  complicated  setup  (command  BOMB).
Please  see  the  interactive  interface  description
for  more  information  on  this  part.


CHNAME           (CHARACTER*4)  volume  name.
THETA            (REAL)  theta  angle  between  the  line  of
                 sight  and  the  Z  axis  of  MAster  Reference
                 System  (MARS).
PHI              (REAL)  phi  angle  between  the  projection  of
                 the  line  of  sight  on  plane  X  Y  and  the  X  axis
                 of  MARS.
PSI              (REAL)  psi  angle  by  which  the  projected
                 image  will  be  rotated  on  the  screen  plane.
U0               (REAL)  u  coordinate  on  the  screen  of  the
                 volume  origin.
V0               (REAL)  v  coordinate  on  the  screen  of  the
                 volume  origin.
SU               (REAL)  scale  factor  for  u  coordinates.
SV               (REAL)  scale  factor  for  v  coordinates.
