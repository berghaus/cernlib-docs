       CALL  GMORIN



GMORIN  initialises  the  MICAP  variables  and  reads
the  cross-section  file  for  the  materials  that
have  been  defined.  It  is  called  from  GFMDIS  when  a
neutron  with  kinetic  energy  below  20  MeV  enters
there  first  time.



       CALL  GFMDIS



GFMDIS  computes  the  distance  to  the  next
interaction  points.  It  calls  the  FLUKA  routines
to  compute  the  cross-sections  for  all  particles
except  neutrons  with  kinetic  energy  below  20  MeV
for  which  MICAP  function  SIGMOR  is  called.  GFMDIS
is  called  from  the  user  routine  GUPHAD  where  the
hadronic  package  can  be  chosen.  The  only
difference  between  GFLDIS  (see  [PHYS520])  and
GFMDIS  is  that  for  the  former,  GHEISHA  hadronic
package  is  called  for  the  neutrons  below  20  MeV,
and  for  the  latter,  the  low-energy  neutrons  are
handled  by  MICAP.



       CALL  GFMFIN



GFMFIN  calls  the  FLUKA  routines  to  generate  the
hadronic  interaction.  For  the  neutrons  with
kinetic  energy  below  20  MeV  GMICAP  is  called.  The



only  difference  between  GFLFIN  (see  [PHYS520])
and  GFMFIN  is  that  for  the  former,  GHEISHA
hadronic  package  is  called  for  the  neutrons  below
20  MeV,  and  for  the  latter,  the  low-energy
neutrons  are  handled  by  MICAP.  GFMFIN  is  called
from  the  user  routine  GUHADR.



       CALL  GMICAP



GMICAP  calls  the  MICAP  routines  to  handle  the
low-energy  interaction  of  neutrons.  It  writes  the
eventual  secondaries  to  the  GEANT  stack.  GMICAP
is  called  from  GFMFIN.

<H2>Method</H2>


<PRE>


MICAP  (A  Monte  Carlo  Ionization  Chamber  Analysis
Package)  ,    is  a  Monte  Carlo  system  to  analyze
ionisation  chamber  responses.  As  a  standalone
program  it  contains  the  code  for  formatting  the
cross-section  files,  neutron  and  photon
transport,  the  geometry  definitions  and  the  code
for  the  chamber  response.  In  GEANT,  only  the
sampling  of  the  neutron  interactions  from  the
already  prepared  cross-section  file  is  included.
The  interface  between  GEANT  and  MICAP  has  been
extracted  from  GCALOR  package  by  C.Zeitnitz  and
T.  Gabriel.


When  using  GEANT-MICAP  interface  the  low-energy
neutrons  are  handled  in  MICAP  routines.  Other
hadrons  and  high-energy  neutrons  are  passed  to
FLUKA  interaction  routines.  For  low-energy
neutrons,  the  total  cross-section  is  given  by
MICAP  and  if  the  neutron  interaction  is  chosen  by
GEANT  tracking  routine,  GMICAP  reads  the
cross-section  for  neutron  interactions
processes,  samples  and  generates  the  interaction
and  the  returns  the  secondary  particles
(nucleons,  heavy  fragments,  or  photons)  to  GEANT.
Information  on  the  recoil  nucleus  (atomic  number
AMED,  charge  ZMED  and  kinetic  energy  ERMED)  can
be  found  in  MCRECO  common  block.  The  program  flow
is  shown  in  figures  ??     and  ??    .


MICAP  uses  pointwise  cross-section  data  (as  a
difference  to  so  called  group  cross-sections
where  the  data  are  averaged  over  certain  energy
intervals).  This  method  has  the  advantage  that

If  the  cross-sections  are  not  found  for  some  of
the  defined  materials,  a  warning  is  printed  first
at  the  initialisation  time  telling  which
cross-section  are  used  (the  closest  Z  available)
instead.  Then,  an  additional  warning  is  printed
each  tracking  step.
