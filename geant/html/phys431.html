       CALL  GTHION



GTHION  transports  heavy  ions  (A, Z>1,  particle
type  8).  For  the  moment  the  only  discrete
processes  activated  are  delta         -ray  and  Cerenkov
photon  generation.

The  mean  energy  loss  of  the  heavy  ions  can  be
expressed  as:

Table  0.1:  Comparison  of  the  measured  and
calculated  Delta         E  for  10  MeV/A  ions  in  Pb



rho                         density  of  the  medium;
t                           step  length


This  formula  is  used  to  calculate  the  ionisation
loss  for  all  the  charged  hadrons.


In  the  case  of  ions,  the  charge  of  the  ion  makes
the  problem  more  difficult.  Electron-exchange
processes  with  the  atoms  change  the  charge  as  the
ion  traverses  the  medium.  The  main  features  of
this  process  can  be  summarised  as  follows:


   *   Q  loses  the  dependence  on  the  initial  ion
       charge  after  a  very  short  initial  step,  usually
       <<    1mu      for  condensed  media;
   *   Q  does  depend  on  the  velocity  of  the  ion;
   *   even  in  the  case  of  constant  velocity,  Q
       fluctuates  around  a  mean  value;
   *   Q  features  a  small  dependence  on  the  medium,
       especially  for  small  values  of  T.


If  we  want  to  calculate  the  energy  loss  of  the
ion,  we  need  a  good  parametrisation  for  the
quantity  Q = Q         .  We  give  here  a  relatively
               eff

simple  parametrisation  :

where  beta         is  the  velocity  and  Z     the  atomic

It  can  be  seen  that  (??    )  neglects  the  (small)
medium  dependence  of  Q         .  For  very  high  energies
                         eff

(beta       - >    1)  Q         - >   Z   .  For  very  low  energies  (T/ A
                        eff             I

few  keV)  the  formula  breaks  down.  Q           can  even
                                         eff

become  negative  for  T/ A<20  keV  and  Z   >20.  However
                                           I

this  is  not  a  serious  source  of  error  when
calculating  Delta         E,  since  in  this  case  the  range
of  the  ion  is  very  small,  and  it  can  almost  be  said
that  it  stops  immediately.


The  calculation  of  the  energy  loss  straggling
(fluctuations)  differs  from  that  of  normal
charged  hadrons.  For  the  charged  hadrons  the
fluctuations  come  from  the  statistical  nature  of
the  projectile-atom  interactions;  for  the  ions
there  is  another  process  which  broadens  the
energy  loss  distribution:  the  fluctuation  of  the
charge.  For  heavier  ions  this  process  dominates
the  energy  loss  straggling  for  T/ A< =    10  MeV.


The  heavy  ions  are  in  the  Gaussian  regime  (see
[PHYS332])  of  the  collisional  fluctuations  even

The  mean  energy  loss  and  energy  loss  fluctuation
calculation  is  performed  in  the  routine  GTHION,
making  use  of  the  proton  energy  loss  tables.


Note:  The  Gaussian  fluctuation  gives  too  broad  a
distribution  for  high  energy  in  the  case  of  thin
absorbers.  A  correction  has  been  introduced  in
GTHION  which  cures  this  discrepancy.  In  the
absence  of  high  energy  straggling  data  for  ions,
the  correction  has  been  tuned  using  high  energy
pi      energy  loss  data,  where  the  pi     has  been  tracked
by  GTHION.

Table  0.4:  Comparison  of  the  measured  and

A  test  has  been  made  against  the  distributions
reported  in    for  He  ions  at  1  and  10  MeV/A  and  for
O  and  Pb  ions  at  1,  10  and  100  MeV/A  in  carbon  and
the  results  were  found  to  be  correct  within  5%
both  for  the  energy  loss  and  the  range.

Another  comparison  has  been  made  with  the  tables

shown  in  table  ??    .  Another  comparison  with  the
same  tables  is  shown  in  Figs.  ??     and  ??    .


A  comparison  with  the  tables  in    for  T/A  <  1  MeV/A

<H3>Comparison  of  FWHM</H3>

A  comparison  has  been  made  with  low  energy  data
(0. 3< =    T/ A< =    2. 5  MeV/A)  in  very  thin  absorbers
(1,7  mu    m,  0.4  mu    m).  Data  are  taken  from  the  tables
in    for  energy  loss  of  O  ions  in  Al,  and  the
results  are  reported  in  table  ??    .  The  quoted
experimental  error  for  these  data  is  1%

Plots  of  energy  deposition  distributions  of  1.4
MeV/A  lead  and  helium  ions  in  gases  can  be  found

compared  them  with  the  ones  given  by  the
MonteCarlo.  The  results  can  be  seen  in  table  ??
and    ??   .  It  should  be  noted  that  the  absorber
thickness  of,  for  example,  Ar  compares  with  that

                                                           -2
of  the  preceding  case  (0.2  cm  Ar  =  356  mu    g  cm

                                      -2
and  1.2  cm  Ar  =  2136  mu    g  cm      ).


Similar  comparison  has  been  made  for  C  ions  of
energies  17.1  and  39.4  MeV  in  isobuthane    and  the
agreement  between  data  and  GEANT  for  FWHM  is
within  30%.
