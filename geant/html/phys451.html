        CALL  GPAIRM



 GPAIRM  generates  the  e+e--pair  radiated  by  a  high
 energetic  muon.  It  uses  the  following  input  and
 output:


 input:                 via  common  block  /GCTRAK/
 output:                via  common  block  /GCKING/


 GPAIRM  is  called  automatically  from  the  tracking
 routine  GTMUON  if,  and  when,  the  parent  muon
 reaches  its  radiation  point  during  the  tracking.

 The  double  differential  cross-section  for  the
 process  can  be  written  :

 ((d   sigma         )/ (dnu    drho      ))                        =         alpha            ((2)/ (3pi    ))(Zlambda           )*

                                                                                                                                   *
 *                      @


 All  the  quantities  in  the  expression  above  are
 defined  in  [PHYS450].  By  computing  this
 cross-section  for  different  (nu    , rho     )  points,  it
 can  be  seen  that:


1.      the  shape  of  the  functions

           2
        ((d   sigma         )/ (dnu    drho      ))  and



                                                       2
        ((dsigma         )/ (dnu    )) R  drho      ((d   sigma         )/ (dnu    drho      ))
        practically  does  not  depend  on  Z
2.      the  dominant  contribution  comes  from  the  low  nu
        region:

                               nu             = (4m/ E)< =    nu   < =    100* nu                                            (2)
                                    min                                             min


                                 2
3.      in  this  low  region  (d   sigma         / dnu    drho      )  is  flat
        as  a  function  of  rho


 Therefore,  we  propose  the  following  sampling
 method  as  a  rough  approximation:


1.      In  the  low  nu     region  the  differential
        cross-section


                                                         2
        ((dsigma         )/ (dnu    )) = R  drho      ((d   sigma         K)/ (dnu    dsigma         ))

        can  be  approximated  as:


                                                                            1/2              a
        ((dsigma         )/ (dnu    )) ss [1- ((nu             )/ (nu    ))]         ((1)/ (v   ))      with:            a = 2- ((l*
 *n    E)/ (10))      (E@
                                                      min

                                                                                                                             (3)
        We  can  write:

                                ((dsigma         )/ (dnu    )) ss f(nu    )g(nu    )                                         (4)

 After  the  successful  sampling  of  (nu    , rho     ),  GPAIRM
 generates  the  polar  angles  of  the  radiated
 e+e--pair  with  respect  to  an  axis  defined  along
 the  parent  muon's  momentum.  Theta           is  assigned  the
 approximate  average  value:


                                             Theta          = ((M)/ (E))                                                  (10)
