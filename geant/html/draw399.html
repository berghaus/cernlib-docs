</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>The  data  structure  JDRAW</H2>


<PRE>    This  data  structure  contains  the  so-called
view  banks.  The  layout  of  the  data  structure  can
be  found  in  Fig.  ??    .  The  meaning  of  the  variables
is  the  following:


NKVIEW                    number  of  views  stored  in  the  structure;
IVIEW                     current  view  selected;
IGU                       current  graphic  unit  pointer;
MAXGU                     number  of  units  in  graphic  unit  bank;
MORGU                     number  of  words  to  push  the  graphic  unit
                          bank;
IGS                       current  graphic  segment  pointer;
MAXGS                     number  of  segments  in  graphic  segment
                          bank;
MORGS                     number  of  words  to  push  the  graphic
                          segment  bank;
ITU                       current  text  unit  pointer;
MAXTU                     number  of  units  in  text  unit  bank;
MORTU                     number  of  words  to  push  the  text  unit
                          bank;
ITS                       current  text  segment  pointer;
MAXTS                     number  of  segments  in  text  segment  bank;
MORTS                     number  of  words  to  push  in  text  segment
                          bank
LENGU                     array  of  lengths  for  each  graphic  unit
                          and  of  line  attributes  (LINATT);
ADDGU                     array  of  addresses  for  each  graphic
                          unit;
ADDTU                     array  of  addresses  for  each  text  unit;
X                         array  of  u  coordinates  of  graphic
                          segments;
Y                         array  v  coordinates  of  graphic
                          segments;
ICUT                      cut  axis  (1,  2,  3  or  0  if  no  cut)  of  the
                          view;
LINWID                    text  line  width  and  text  attributes
                          (ITXATT);


GTHETA,  GPHI,  GPSI,  GU0,  GV0,  GSCU,  GSCV,  are  the
viewing  parameters  stored  in  /GCDRAW/.


U0,  V0,  SIZE,  ANGLE,  IOPT,  ITEXT  have  the  same
meaning  of  those  given  as  arguments  to  GDRAWT  (or
HPLSOF  ).



A  control  word  is  stored  in  Q(JDRAW+IVIEW),  with
the  following  meaning:


1             empty  bank  (created  by  internal  routines  to
              avoid  gaps)  or  for  deleted  banks;
2             bank  created  by  the  user;
3             protected  bank  reserved  for  internal  use:  it
              cannot  be  deleted  by  the  user.
