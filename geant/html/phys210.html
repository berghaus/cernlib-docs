       CALL  GPRSGA



GPRSGA  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for  the
pair  production  of  photons  and  the  direct  pair
production  of  muons  in  all  materials.  It
tabulates  the  mean  free  path,  lambda            = 1/ Sigma           (in
cm),  as  a  function  of  the  medium  and  the  energy.
For  the  pair  production  by  photons,  it  calls  the
function  GPRSGG.  The  energy  bins  are  the  one  of
the  array  ELOW  in  common  /CGMULO/  initialised  in
the  routine  GPHYSI.  The  following  pointers  are
used:



                                                                           th
JMA  =  LQ(JMATE-I)                                     pointer  to  the  I        material
JPAIR  =  LQ(JMA-10)                                    pointer  to  pair  production
                                                        cross-sections


GPRSGA  is  called  at  initialisation  time  by
GPHYSI.



       VALUE    =    GPRSGG                            (Z,E)



GPRSGG  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for  the
pair  production  of  a  photon  with  energy  E  in
material  with  atomic  number  Z.  It  is  called  by
GPRSGA.

<H2>Method</H2>



<PRE>


We  have  parameterised  the  total  cross-section  of
e+e--pair  production  by  photon  as:



sigma         (Z, E               ) = Z(Z+1)(F   (X)+F   (X)Z+F   (X)/ Z)   (barn/atom)
                   gamma                      1       2        3

                                                                                                                            (1)


where



    X                          =         ln   (E               / m),
                                                gamma


    m                          =         electron  mass,



    E                          =         photon  energy
     gamma



and



                                            5           n
    F   (X)                    =         sum       c   X
     i                                    n=0       n



The  parameters  c     were  taken  from  a  least-square
                  n

fit  to  the  data    and  can  be  found  in  the  DATA
statement  in  the  function  GPRSGG(Z,E)  which
computes  the  formula  (??    )  (in  barn/atom).


This  parameterisation  gives  a  good  description  of
the  data  in  the  range:



                         1< =    Z< =    100
.                                                                          "        ((Delta           sigma         )/ (sigma      *
 *   ))< =    5%       @

     1. 5 MeV     < =    E               < =   100 GeV
                          gamma

                                                                                                                            (2)


This  mean  free  path  is  tabulated  at
initialisation  as  a  function  of  the  medium  and  of
the  energy  by  the  routine  GPRSGA.
