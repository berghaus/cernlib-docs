       CALL  GNEXT                       (X,SNEXT*,SAFETY*)



       CALL  GTNEXT                         (X,SNEXT*,SAFETY*)



Finds  distance  to  the  next  boundary.  It  takes
explicit  account  of  shape  content  and  uniqueness.


X                         (REAL)  array  of  6  of  coordinates  and
                          direction  cosines;
SNEXT                     (REAL)  distance  to  the  nearest  volume
                          boundary  along  the  particle  direction;
SAFETY                    (REAL)  safety  distance,  that  is  smaller
                          distance  to  any  boundary;


This  routine  evaluates  the  two  distances  which
are  needed  by  the  GEANT  tracking  routines.  GTNEXT
and  GNEXT  perform  the  same  function,  but  GNEXT  is
a  static  routine  which  can  be  called  by  the  user,
while  GTNEXT  is  the  routines  used  internally  by
GEANT  during  tracking,  and  it  should  not  be
called  by  the  user.


If  INFROM  (common  /GCVOLU/)  is  different  from  0,
GTNEXT  interprets  it  as  the  daughter  out  of  which
the  particle  just  came,  and  uses  the  list  of
daughters  stored  with  that  volume,  possibly
modified  by  GSNEXT/GSNEAR  to  calculate  the
distance  to  the  next  boundary.


The  first  action  of  GTNEXT  is  to  calculate  the
SAFETY  distance.  If  this  is  larger  than  the
current  step  candidate,  no  other  calculation  is
performed  and  the  IGNEXT  flag  (common  /GCTRAK/)
is  set  to  0,  indicating  that  no  change  of  volume
is  occurring  at  the  end  of  the  current  step.  If
the  step  is  smaller  than  safety,  then  SNEXT  is
computed.  If  the  step  is  smaller  than  SNEXT,



again  there  will  not  be  any  change  of  volume
during  the  step  and  IGNEXT  is  set  to  0.  If  on  the
contrary  the  candidate  step  is  larger  than  SNEXT,
a  change  of  volume  will  occur  at  the  end  of  the
step,  and  IGNEXT  is  set  to  1  and  INGOTO  (common
/GCTRAK/)  is  set  to  the  number  of  the  daughter
where  the  particle  is  entering,  if  any.


Charged  particles  in  magnetic  field  are
transported  with  a  similar  logic.  However,  even
if  the  candidate  step  is  smaller  than  SNEXT,  the
particle  can  still  cross  into  another  volume  due
to  its  bent  path.  When  tracking  in  magnetic
field,  after  every  step  greater  than  SAFETY  it  is
checked  whether  the  particle  is  still  in  the  same
volume.  If  this  is  not  the  case,  the  step  is
divided  by  two  and  transport  is  tried  again.
Conversely  a  charged  particle  in  magnetic  field
may  still  be  in  the  current  volume  even  after
having  travelled  the  distance  to  the  nearest
boundary  along  a  straight  line.  So  boundary
crossing  is  declared  only  when  IGNEXT  is
different  from  0  and  the  difference  between  the
real  trajectory  and  the  bent  one  is  smaller  than
EPSIL  (common  /GCTMED/).
