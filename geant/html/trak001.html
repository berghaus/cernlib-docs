<H2>Introduction</H2>


<PRE>


In  GEANT  tracking  a  particle  through  a  geometry
of  objects  consists  in  calculating  a  set  of
points  in  a  seven-dimensional  space  (x,  y,  z,  t,
p   ,  p   ,  p   )  which  is  called  the  trajectory  of  the
 x      y      z

particle.  This  is  achieved  by  integrating  the
equations  of  motion  over  successive  steps  from
one  trajectory  point  to  the  next  and  applying
corrections  to  account  for  the  presence  of
matter.


To  have  a  detailed  description  of  the  kinematic
of  the  particle  it  would  be  necessary  to
calculate  a  trajectory  point  every  time  the
component  of  the  momentum  change.  This  is  not
possible  because  it  would  mean  calculating  an
enormously  large  number  of  points.  Processes  like
the  deviation  of  a  charged  particle  in  a  magnetic
field,  the  loss  of  energy  due  to  bremsstrahlung
and  ionisation  or  the  deviation  due  to  elastic
electromagnetic  scatterings  are  essentially
continuous.  An  arbitrary  distinction  is  thus  made
between  discrete  and  continuous  processes,
controlled  by  a  set  of  thresholds  which  can  be  set
by  the  user.  A  particle  trajectory  is  thus  a  set
of  points  at  which  a  discrete  process  has
happened.


The  tracking  package  contains  a  subprogram  which
performs  the  tracking  for  all  particles  in  the
current  event  and  for  the  secondary  products
which  they  generate,  plus  some  tools  for  storing
the  space  point  coordinates  computed  along  the
corresponding  trajectories.

<H2>The  step  size</H2>



<PRE>


When  tracking  particles  through  a  complex
structure  one  of  the  critical  tasks  is  the
estimation  a  priori  of  the  step  size.  This  is
performed  automatically  by  the  program.  For  a
particle  with  a  given  energy  the  step  size
depends  primarily  on  the  intrinsic  properties  of
the  particle  (mass,  charge,  lifetime,  etc.)  and
on  the  characteristics  of  the  current  medium.  The
dependence  may  be  due  either  to  the
(quasi)continuous  processes  which  usually  impose
a  limit  to  the  interval  of  integration  (energy
loss,  multiple  scattering  ...)  or  to  the
occurrence  of  a  discrete  process  which  introduces
a  discontinuity  in  the  trajectory  (decay,
electromagnetic  or  hadronic  interaction).  The
modification  of  the  kinematic  parameters
(position  and  energy)  due  to  continuous  processes
between  two  discrete  ones  is  taken  into  account
and  the  necessary  modifications  are  applied  at
the  end  of  the  step.


In  addition  to  the  physical  effects  there  are
constraints  of  a  geometrical  nature,  the  step
being  limited  by  the  path  length  to  the  medium
boundary.  In  practice,  the  step  size  depends
ultimately  on  a  set  of  tolerances  and  cuts,  which
the  program  will  set  automatically,  but  which  may
be  also  optimised  by  the  user,  such  as:


   *   the  maximum  turning  angle  due  to  magnetic  field
       permitted  in  one  step;
   *   the  maximum  fractional  energy  loss  in  one  step;
   *   the  maximum  geometrical  step  allowed;
   *   the  accuracy  for  crossing  medium  boundaries;
   *   the  minimum  step  size  due  to  either  energy  loss
       or  multiple  scattering.


These  quantities  are  part  of  the  so-called
tracking  medium  parameters.  They  can  either  be
calculated  by  the  program  or  provided  by  the  user
and  are  stored  in  the  data  structure  JTMED,
through  the  routine  GSTMED  (see  [CONS]).  Usually,
this  is  done  together  with  the  initialisation  of
the  geometrical  setup.  The  optimisation  is  by  no
means  trivial  as  the  economy  of  computing  time
should  not  lead  to  an  unacceptable  loss  of
accuracy.


Other  information  required  for  the  computation  of
the  step  size  is  found  in  the  data  structures
JPART  and  JMATE,  for  the  properties  of  the
particles  and  of  the  materials,  and  in  the  data
structure  JVOLUM,  for  the  current  medium  and  its
geometrical  boundaries.  The  communication



 between  the  tracking  package  and  the  structure
 JVOLUM  is  achieved  through  the  basic  subroutines
 of  the  geometry  package  GMEDIA,  GTMEDI,  GTNEXT
 and  GINVOL  (see  [GEOM]).  Some  information  is
 computed  at  tracking  time  such  as  the  probability
 of  occurrence  of  an  interaction.


 For  convenience  every  particle  is  assigned  a
 tracking  type:


1.      gamma           (GTGAMA);


2.      e     (GTELEC);
3.      neutral  hadrons  and  neutrinos  (GTNEUT);
4.      charged  hadrons  (GTHADR);
5.      muons  (GTMUON);
6.      geantinos,  particles  only  sensitive  to
        geometry  used  for  debugging  (GTNINO);
7.      Cerenkov  photons  (GTCKOV);
8.      heavy  ions  (GTHION).


 Which  processes  have  to  be  considered  for  a  given
 particle  depends  on  its  tracking  type.  For  the
 hadrons  it  depends  also,  through  the  subroutine
 GUPHAD,  on  which  hadronic  processes  from  GHEISHA,
 FLUKA  have  been  selected  (see  [PHYS001]).


 </PRE>


 <H2>Transport  subroutines</H2>


 <PRE>


 At  the  event  level  the  tracking  is  controlled  by
 the  subroutine  GTREVE  called  by  the  subroutine
 GUTREV  where  the  user  can  perform  additional
 actions.  GTREVE  loops  over  all  vertices  and  for
 every  vertex  in  turn  stores  all  tracks  in  the
 stack  JSTAK.  Then  tracking  begins:  particles  are
 fetched  from  JSTAK  by  GLTRAC  which  prepares  the
 commons  for  tracking.  GUTRAK  is  then  called,
 which  calls  GTRACK.  The  subroutine  GTRACK
 transports  the  particle  up  to  the  its  end:  stop,
 decay,  interaction  or  escape.  During  this  phase
 it  may  happen  that  secondary  products  have  been
 generated  and  stored  by  the  user,  as  explained
 below,  in  the  JSTAK  stack,  and  possibly  in  the
 permanent  structure  JKINE.


 The  subroutine  GTRACK  transports  the  track
 through  the  geometrical  volumes  identifying,
 through  the  subroutine  GTMEDI,  every  new  volume
 which  the  particle  has  reached,  and  storing  the
 corresponding  material  and  tracking  medium
 constants  in  the  common  blocks  /GCMATE/  and
 /GCTMED/.  The  actual  transport  is  performed  by  a



different  routine  for  each  tracking  type,  as
indicated  in  the  previous  section.  These  compute
the  physical  step  size  according  to  the  activated
physics  processes,  and  compute  the  geometrical
limit  for  the  step,  only  when  necessary,  through
GTNEXT,  and  propagate  the  particle  over  the
computed  step.

<H2>Magnetic  field  transport  routines</H2>


<PRE>


Once  the  step  size  has  been  decided,  transport
proceeds  along  a  straight  lines  for  all  neutral
particles  and  for  charged  particle  in  absence  of
magnetic  field.  When  magnetic  field  is  present,
the  direction  of  charged  particles  will  change
along  the  step.  The  routine  GUSWIM  calculates  the
deviation  in  magnetic  field  over  a  given  step.
Depending  on  the  tracking  medium  parameter  IFIELD
the  GUSWIM  routine  calls:


   *   GRKUTA  for  inhomogeneous  fields,  IFIELD=1;
   *   GHELIX  for  quasi-homogeneous  fields,
       IFIELD=2;
   *   GHELX3  for  uniform  fields  along  the  z  axis,
       IFIELD=3).


GRKUTA  and  GHELIX  call  the  user  subroutine  GUFLD
to  obtain  the  components  of  the  field  in  a  given
point.  GHELX3  takes  the  value  of  the  field  from
the  tracking  medium  parameter  FIELDM.


</PRE>


<H2>The  subroutine  GUSTEP</H2>


<PRE>


The  current  track  parameters  are  available  in  the
common  /GCTRAK/  together  with  all  variables
necessary  to  the  tracking  routines  for  the
control  of  the  step  size.  In  addition,  a  few  flags
and  variables  are  stored  in  the  common  block
/GCTRAK/  to  record  the  history  of  the  current
step:


   *   The  flag  INWVOL  informs  on  the  boundary
       crossing:

       0             transport  inside  a  volume;
       1             entering  a  new  volume  or  beginning  of  new
                     track;
       2             exiting  a  volume;
       3             exiting  the  first  mother;



   *   The  flag  ISTOP  informs  on  the  particle  status:

       0             normal  transport;
       1             particle  has  disappeared  (decay,
                     interaction...);
       2             particle  has  crossed  a  threshold  (time,
                     energy...).

   *   The  array  LMEC  informs  on  the  mechanisms  active
       in  the  current  step.  The  mechanism  names  are
       stored  in  ASCII  equivalent  in  LMEC(1...NMEC).
   *   The  total  energy  loss  in  the  current  step  is
       stored  in  the  variable  DESTEP.


This  information  is  necessary  for  the  user  to
take  the  proper  actions  in  the  subroutine  GUSTEP
which  is  called  by  GTRACK  at  the  end  of  every  step
and  when  entering  a  new  volume.


The  variable  NGKINE  in  common  /GCKING/  contains
the  number  of  secondary  particles  generated  at
every  step,  and  which  are  stored  in  the  same
common.  Depending  on  the  application  and  on  the
particle  type  the  user  may  then  take  the
appropriate  action  in  GUSTEP:


   *   ignore  the  particle;
   *   store  the  secondary  produced  in  the  JSTAK  stack
       for  further  tracking;
   *   store  the  secondary  also  in  the  JKINE/JVERTX
       structure  where  it  will  be  kept  till  the  end  of
       the  event.

<H2>Connection  with  the  detector  response
package</H2>


<PRE>


The  detector  response  package  ([HITS])  allows  to
establish  a  correspondence  between  the  volumes
seen  by  the  particle  and  the  active  components  of
the  detectors.  When  entering  a  new  volume  in
GTRACK  the  subroutine  GFINDS  is  called.  If  the
volume  has  been  declared  by  the  user  as  a
sensitive  detector  through  appropriate  calls  to
GSDET  and  if  the  corresponding  tracking  medium
constant  ISVOL  is  non  zero,  GFINDS  fills  the
common  block  /GCSETS/  with  the  information  to
identify  uniquely  the  detector  component.  This
enables  the  user,  in  GUSTEP,  to  record  the  hits  in
the  proper  JHITS  substructure  [HITS].


</PRE>


<H2>Connection  with  the  drawing  package</H2>



<PRE>


The  coordinates  of  the  space  points  generated
during  the  tracking  are  available  at  each  step  in
the  common  block/GCTRAK/.  In  GUSTEP  the  user  can
store  them  in  the  structure  JXYZ  with  the  help  of
the  subroutine  GSXYZ.  This  information  can  be
used  later  for  debugging  (subroutine  GPJXYZ)  or
for  the  graphical  representation  of  the  particle
trajectories  [DRAW].
