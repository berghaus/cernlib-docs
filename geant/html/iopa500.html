       CALL  GRIN                     (CHOBJ,IDVERS*,CHOPT)



CHOBJ                     (CHARACTER*(4))  name  of  the  data
                          structure  to  read  in,  see  [IOPA300]  for
                          more  information  on  this;
IDVERS                    (INTEGER)  version  of  the  data  structure
                          to  be  read  in,  if  0  it  will  read  any
                          version,  on  output  it  contains  the
                          version  of  the  data  structure  read  in;
CHOPT                     (CHARACTER*(*))  option:

                          I             perform  read  only  if  CHOBJ  is  an
                                        initialisation  data  structure;
                          K             perform  read  only  if  CHOBJ  is  KINE
                                        or  TRIG;
                          T             perform  read  only  if  CHOBJ  is  DIGI,
                                        HEAD,  HITS,  KINE,  VERT  or  JXYZ;
                          Q             quiet  option,  no  message  is
                                        printed;


This  routine  reads  GEANT  data  structures  from  the
current  working  directory  of  an  RZ  file  (see  the
ZEBRA  documentation  for  a  clarification  of  this
concept).  Example:


           CALL  GRFILE(1,'Geometry.dat','  ')
           CALL  GRIN  ('VOLU',1,'  ')
           CALL  GRIN  ('MATE',1,'  ')
           CALL  GRIN  ('TMED',1,'  ')
           CALL  GRIN  ('ROTM',1,'  ')
           CALL  GRIN  ('PART',1,'  ')
           CALL  GRIN  ('SCAN',1,'  ')
           CALL  GRIN  ('SETS',1,'  ')


The  same  result  can  be  achieved  by:


           CALL  GRFILE(1,'Geometry.dat','I')



       CALL  GROUT                       (CHOBJ,IDVERS,CHOPT)



The  meaning  of  the  arguments  is  the  same  than  in
the  previous  routine  GRIN,  but  for  writing
instead  than  for  reading.


This  routine  writes  GEANT  data  structures  into
the  current  working  directory  of  an  RZ  file  (see
the  ZEBRA  documentation  for  a  clarification  of
this  concept).  Note  that  if  the  cross-sections
and  energy  loss  tables  are  available  in  the  data
structure  JMATE,  then  they  are  saved  on  the  data
base.  The  data  structures  saved  by  this  routine
can  be  retrieved  with  the  routine  GRIN.  Before
calling  this  routine  a
tt  RZ  data  base  must  have  been  created  using
GRFILE.  The  data  base  must  be  closed  with  RZEND.
Example:


           CALL  GRFILE(1,'Geometry.dat','N')
           CALL  GROUT  ('VOLU',1,'  ')
           CALL  GROUT  ('MATE',1,'  ')
           CALL  GROUT  ('TMED',1,'  ')
           CALL  GROUT  ('ROTM',1,'  ')
           CALL  GROUT  ('PART',1,'  ')
           CALL  GROUT  ('SCAN',1,'  ')
           CALL  GROUT  ('SETS',1,'  ')


The  same  result  can  be  achieved  by:


           CALL  GRFILE(1,'Geometry.dat','NO')


The  interactive  version  of  tt  GEANT  provides
facilities  to  interactively  update,  create  and
display  objects.


The  routines  GRGET  and  GRSAVE  are  obsolete  and
should  not  be  used.
