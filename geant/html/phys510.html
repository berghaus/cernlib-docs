<H2>Introduction  </H2>


<PRE>


There  are  two  packages  to  describe  the  hadronic
showers  in  matter  which  are  available  to  the
users  of  GEANT:  GHEISHA    and  FLUKA  (see
[PHYS520]).


The  GHEISHA  code  generates  hadronic  interactions
with  the  nuclei  of  the  current  tracking  medium,
evaluating  cross-sections  and  sampling  the  final
state  multiplicity  and  kinematics,  while  the
GEANT  philosophy  is  preserved  for  the  tracking.
The  GHEISHA  code  is  stored  in  the  GEANH  car  file.


The  GHEISHA  printing  flags  can  be  set  via  the
GEANT  SWIT  data  record:  each  switch  greater  than
100  but  smaller  that  111  sets  the  corresponding
printing  flag  of  GHEISHA  modulo  100,  so  that  SWIT
105  will  set  the  printing  flag  5  of  GHEISHA.
Setting  the  printing  flags  of  GHEISHA  the
following  information  will  be  displayed:


NPRT(1)                   one  header  for  each  track  in  the  shower;
NPRT(2)                   all  tracking  information;
NPRT(3)                   kinematic  of  decays  (not  effective);
NPRT(4)                   kinematic  of  nuclear  interactions;
NPRT(5)                   kinematic  of  electromagnetic
                          interactions  (not  effective);
NPRT(6)                   material  constants,  dE/dX  and  absorbed
                          energies  (not  effective);
NPRT(7)                   event  summary;
NPRT(8)                   history  of  all  interactions/decays;
NPRT(9)                   free;
NPRT(10)                  tables  of  the  geometry,  cross-sections,
                          etc.;


NPRT(1),  NPRT(2)  and  NPRT(6)  should  be  used  only
in  case  of  suspected  errors.  NPRT(8)  produces  the



most  illustrative  output.  Those  flags  work  in
conjunction  with  the  DEBUG  data  record  of  GEANT.

                               (normalised  to  one),  one  in  case  of  an
                               element;
NLM                            (INTEGER)  number  of  components  of  the
                               mixture,  1  in  case  of  an  element;

                               corrections  are  applied  to  the
                               cross-section;  should  be  used  in  case
                               of  inorganic  scintillators;
IPART                          (INTEGER)  GEANT  particle  code.


This  routine  returns  the  total  macroscopic

                    th
taken  from  the  26        word  of  the  next  bank  in  the
tracking  medium  linear  structure  pointed  at  by
LQ(JTMED-NUMED).


The  cross-sections  on  nucleus  are  known  only  for



pions  and  protons.  The  general  law:


                                                              Proton             alpha

                                                              tot


is  used  but  it  is  valid  only  for  momenta  >  2  GeV.
The  parametrisation  done  gives  only  a  behaviour
averaged  over  momenta  and  particle  types.  For  H,
Al,  Cu  and  Pb  the  measured  cross-sections  are
stored  in  DATA  statements.


The  stored  cross-sections  are  the  pre-calculated
GHEISHA  ones.  As  a  starting  point  the  measured
cross-sections  of  pions,  kaons,  protons,
antiprotons  and  neutrons  on  protons  are  used.  The
cross-sections  tabulated  are  measured  values
taken  from  the  CERN  HERA  compilations.  The  values

      0    0
for  K   /K     are  updated  as  of  July  1980.  Strange

      s    l

baryon  cross-section  are  calculated  using  a
parametrisation  in  terms  of  quark-quark  forward
scattering  amplitudes  and  optical  theorem.  The
additive  quark  quark  scattering  model  is  used.
All  the  cross-sections  are  contained  in  data
statements  so  no  external  file  is  needed  for
GHEISHA.



       CALL  GPGHEI



This  routine  returns  the  distance  to  the  next
hadronic  interaction  according  to  the  GHEISHA
cross-sections.  It  calls  GHESIG  and  is  called  by
GUPHAD.  The  default  copy  provided  in  the  GEANT
library  uses  the  GHEISHA  shower  code:

       CALL  GHEISH



This  is  the  main  steering  routine  for  the
hadronic  interactions  and  is  a  fan-out  to  the
various  cascade  routines  of  GHEISHA  which  treat
the  particular  hadronic  interaction.  Here  the
kind  of  interaction  is  stored  in  the  INT  flag,
with  the  following  meaning:


INT=0                     no  interaction  (NONE);
INT=1                     elastic  scattering  occurs  (ECOH);
INT=2                     inelastic  incoherent  interaction  occurs
                          (INHE),  1  and  2  include  also  nuclear
                          reaction  processes  at  very  low
                          energies;
INT=3                     nuclear  fission  with  inelastic
                          scattering  occurs  (FISS);
INT=4                     neutron  nuclear  capture  occurs  (CAPT).


After  the  interaction  has  been  selected,  the
appropriate  cascade  routine  is  called.  Upon  exit
from  this  there  is  a  check  whether  the
interaction  has  generated  new  particles  or  not.
If  yes,  the  new  particles  are  copied  in  the  GEANT
temporary  stack  (GKING).  If  the  particle  is  a
heavy  fragment  or  a  proton  and  it  is  below  the
energy  cut  specified  via  the  CUTS  data  record,  it
is  not  stored  in  the  stack  but  the  kinetic  energy
is  collected.  The  size  of  the  GHEISHA  stack  is
parametrised,  and  its  limit  is  currently  set  to
100  in  sequence  GCKMAX.  The  user  is  left  to  decide
in  GUSTEP  what  to  do  with  the  new  tracks.  This
routine  is  called  also  in  case  of  a  stopping
hadron,  i.e.  with  kinetic  energy  below  the  GEANT
cuts.  In  this  case  the  routine  GHSTOP  (see  later)
is  called  to  handle  the  stopping  hadron.  The
printing  flags  for  GHEISHA  are  also  set  in  this
routine  according  to  the  current  value  of  IDEBUG.


This  routine  must  be  called  by  the  user  routine



GUHADR  (see  above).


As  explained  above,  for  inorganic  scintillators
such  as  the  BGO,  it  is  possible  to  activate  a
correction  to  the  hadronic  cross-section.  This  is
done  via  the  routine  GSTPAR  in  the  following  way:
           CALL  GSTPAR(ITMED,'GHCOR1',1.0)


The  parameter  is  actually  a  flag  which,  if
different  from  0,  triggers  the  calculation  of  the
cross-section  correction,  but  in  view  of  future
developments  it  is  good  practice  set  it  to  1.0
when  those  corrections  are  required.  ITMED  is  the
tracking  medium  number  as  used  in  GSTMED  for
which  corrections  are  requested.  This  routine  has
to  be  called  before  GPHYSI.



       CALL  GHSTOP



This  is  an  internal  routine  used  to  handle
stopping  particles,  called  by  GHEISH.  Here  again
we  have  a  switch  to  the  various  routines  handling
stopping  particles.  In  particular  this  routine
can  lead  to  nuclear  absorption  for  negative  pions
and  negative  kaons  (ABSO)  and  to  annihilation  for
antineutrons,  and  antiprotons  (ANNH).  The
kinetic  energy  is  completely  absorbed,  and  in  the
case  of  an  unstable  particle,  the  particle  is
decayed  at  rest  via  the  standard  GEANT  decay
routine  GDECAY.
