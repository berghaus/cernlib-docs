ICD                       (INTEGER)  digitised  current  division
                          information  (< =    ICD     < =   1000),  overwritten

                          relative  to  the  each  pulse  heights.


Routine  to  calculate  the  error  on  the  current
division  information  as  obtained  by  GCDRIF.  Here
we  assume  that  ICD  has  been  determined  by
measuring  the  pulse  heights  I   , I     at  the  two  ends
                                 1     2

of  the  wire  with  the  formula:


        ICD      = L ((I   )/ (I   ))               with                       I    = I    + I

Its  error  is  determined  by:


delta         ICD       =- ((ICD      )/ (I   ))delta         I   +((L- ICD     )/ (I   ))delta         I           and            *

delta              and  delta              are  of  dimension  [I]  and
              1                       2

represent  the  pedestal  errors.  epsilon                  and
                                                       1

epsilon                  are  the  slope  errors.  Errors  are
                    2

independent  (no  correlations),  with  a  Gaussian
distribution  with  average  0  and  ERP  as  relative
variance  for  pedestals  delta            / I     and  ERS  as
                                        i     +

variance  for  slopes  epsilon                .  This  gives  the

GCDERR  sets  the  ICD  obtained  from  GCDRIF  to
ICD      = ICD      + delta         ICD       with  0< =    ICD     < =   L.



       VALUE    =    GUDTIM                            (DETREP,HITREP,IW1,DIS)



The  arguments  have  the  same  meaning  than  for
GCDRIF  apart  from:


IW1                       (INTEGER)  wire  number  which  will
                          generate  a  signal;
DIS                       (REAL)  distance  from  the  track  to  the
                          wire;


This  function  has  to  be  written  by  the  user  to
return  the  drift  time  in  nanoseconds.
