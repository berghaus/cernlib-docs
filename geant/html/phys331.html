       CALL  GDRAY



GDRAY  generates  explicitly  the  delta-rays  (see
[PHYS330]  for  treatment  of  the  ionization  as
continuous  energy  loss  and  for  the  calculation  of
the  total  cross-section).


input:                         common  /GCTRAK/
output:                        common  /GCKING/


The  routine  is  called  from  the  tracking  routines
GTELEC,  GTMUON,  GTHION  and  GTHADR  when  a  charged
particle  reaches  its  interaction  point.

production  can  be  written  as  in  equations  (??    ,

 GDRAY  samples  the  variable  epsilon              by:


1.      sample  epsilon              from  f(epsilon             )
2.      calculate  the  rejection  function  g(epsilon             )
        and  accept  the  sampled  epsilon              with  a
        probability  of  g(epsilon             ).



After  the  successful  sampling  of  epsilon             ,  GDRAY
generates  the  polar  angles  of  the  scattered
electron  with  respect  to  the  direction  of  the
incident  particle.  The  azimuthal  angle  phi       is
generated  isotropically;  the  polar  angle  theta           is
calculated  from  the  energy  momentum
conservation.  This  information  is  used  to
calculate  the  energy  and  momentum  of  both
scattered  particles  and  to  transform  them  into
the  GEANT  coordinate  system.
