</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Tracking  inside  volumes  and
optimisation</H2>


<PRE>


The  tracking  of  particles  through  the  geometrical
data  structure  is  the  key  functionality  of  GEANT.
At  every  particle's  step,  the  program  must  find
the  volume  where  the  particle  is  (GTMEDI)  and  the
next  boundary  it  will  cross  (GTNEXT).  This  can
take  about  60%  of  the  total  simulation  time  (even
for  detectors  described  in  an  optimized  way);
therefore,  a  new  logic  has  been  introduced  to
minimize  the  time  spent  for  the  search  in  the
geometrical  tree.

<H2>  Virtual  divisions</H2>


<PRE>


Instead  of  a  linear  or  binary  search  (time  spent
proportional  or  logarithmic  with  the  number  of
volumes,  respectively),  a  `direct  access'
technique  has  been  developed  to  make  the  time
basically  independent  from  the  number  of  volumes.
Every  volume  containing  other  volumes  is
`virtually'  divided  in  equal  slices  at
initialization  time  via  the  call  to  GGCLOS  (the
best  axis  is  computed  automatically).  For  each
slice,  a  data  structure  is  filled  with  a  list  of
the  volumes  identifiers  intersecting  such  slice.
Slices  with  identical  lists  are  pointing  to  the
same  contents  and  are  collected.  At  tracking  time
it  is  immediate  to  find  in  which  slice  the
particle  is  and  only  its  contents  have  to  be
checked.  The  same  is  true  to  find  the  next
boundary  to  be  crossed:  only  if  the  intersection
point  with  a  content  lies  outside  the  current
collection  of  slices,  the  next  one  will  be
checked.  The  algorithm  gives  in  average  about  a
factor  2  in  speed  for  the  overall  simulation  in
the  large  detectors.  It  also  minimizes  the
dependency  of  the  performance  on  the  skill  and
experience  of  the  programmer  and  allows  a  fast
tracking  even  in  geometrical  structures  received
from  CAD  systems.

 <H2>  Other  optimisation  tools</H2>


 <PRE>


 The  following  facilities  are  kept  for  backward
 compatibility  reasons.  If  called  by  the  user,
 these  optimisation  tools  are  called  at
 initialisation  time,  but  not  used  at  tracking
 time.  Instead,  the  new  optimisation  using
 'virtual  divisions'  is  performed.  If  the  user
 wants  to  use  the  older  optimisation  tools,  he  can
 recompile  GEANT  3.21  using  the  PATCHY  flag  +OLD.


1.      GSORD/GGORD
        From  the  position  of  the  contents  inside  a
        given  volume,  the  subroutine  GSORD  computes
        fictitious  boundaries  along  the  specified
        coordinate,  simulating  a  division  with
        irregular  step  size.  A  binary  search  technique
        is  used  to  identify  within  which  pseudo-cell
        the  current  point  is.  The  slow  process  of
        computing  whether  the  point  is  inside  or
        outside  the  contents  is  therefore  limited  to
        the  few  (if  any)  volumes  overlapping  with  that
        pseudo-cell,  as  sketched  in  fig  ??    .

 Figure  1:  Example  of  pseudo-cells  created  by
 GSORD



        The  coordinate  selected  for  the  pseudo
        division  can  be  any  of  X,  Y,  Z,  R      ,  R,  phi       or
                                                 xy

        theta         ;.  For  a  given  volume,  the  call  to  GSORD
        has  to  come  after  all  its  first  level  contents
        have  been  positioned.
2.      GSNEXT/GSNEAR
        when  a  particle  exits  from  a  daugther  of  a
        mother  volume,  the  contents  are  scanned
        initially  in  the  order  in  which  they  have  been
        positioned,  and  the  user  should  take  care  over
        the  best  sequence  of  GSPOS  calls.  However,  when
        the  particle  comes  back  inside  the  mother  from
        any  one  of  the  contents,  it  is  usually  possible
        to  limit  the  search  to  the  neighbour  contents.
        The  subroutines  GSNEXT/GSNEAR  permit  the  user
        to  inject,  at  initialisation  time,  for  each
        content  in  turn,  the  list  of  neighbours  to
        search  for.  GSNEAR  is  recommended,  GSNEXT  is
        kept  for  backward,  compatibility  and  has  a
        different  default  option.  A  proper  use  of  this



        facility  can  reduce  the  search  time
        significantly.
3.      GSUNEA/GUNEAR
        The  volumes  to  be  checked  when  exiting  from  one
        daughter  can  depend  on  the  direction  and
        position  of  the  exiting  particles.  To  optimise
        tracking  taking  into  account  these  dynamic
        features,  the  user  can  code  the  GUNEAR  routine,
        and  inform  GEANT  that  it  has  to  use  it  at
        tracking  time  by  calling  the  GSUNEA  routine.
