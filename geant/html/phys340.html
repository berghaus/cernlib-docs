       CALL  GBRELA



GBRELA  fills  the  tables  for  the  energy  loss  of
electrons,  positrons  and  muons  due  to
bremsstrahlung  at  initialisation  time  for
different  materials.  The  energy  binning  is  set
within  the  array  ELOW  (common  /CGMULO/)  in  the
routine  GPHYSI.  In  the  tables,  the  dE/dx  due  to
bremsstrahlung  is  summed  with  that  due  to  the
ionisation.  For  energy  loss  of  electrons  and
positrons,  GBRELA  calls  the  function  GBRELE.
Following  pointers  are  used:



                                                                      th
JMA  =  LQ(JMATE-I)                                pointer  to  the  I        material;
JEL1  =  LQ(JMA-1)                                 pointer  to  dE/ dx  for  e-;
JEL1+NEK1                                          pointer  to  dE/ dx  for  e+.


GBRELA  is  called  at  initialisation  time  by
GPHYSI.



       VALUE    =    GBRELE                            (ZZ,T,BCUT)



GBRELE  calculates  the  energy  loss  due  to
bremsstrahlung  of  an  electron  with  kinetic  energy
T  in  material  with  atomic  number  ZZ.  It  is  called
by  GBRELA  and  for  energies  below  the  cut  BCUT  it
adds  the  contribution  of  bremsstrahlung  to.  Above
this  cut,  the  bremsstrahlung  process  is  simulated
explicitly  (see  [PHYS341])  and  tabulation  of



these  continuous  losses  is  not  needed.  GBRELE  is
called  by  GBRELA.



       VALUE    =    GBFLOS                            (T,C)



GBFLOS  calculates  a  weight  factor  for  the
positron  continuous  bremsstrahlung  energy  loss.
T  is  the  kinetic  energy  in  GeV  of  the  positron  and
C  is  the  energy  cut  for  bremsstrahlung  (BCUTE).
The  value  is  the  ratio  of  the  energy  loss  due  to
bremsstrahlung  of  the  positron  to  that  of  the
electron  so  that:  <positron  loss>  =  GBFLOS  x
<electron  loss>.  GBFLOS  is  called  by  GBRELA.



       CALL  GBRSGA



GBRSGA  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for
bremsstrahlung  in  all  materials.  It  tabulates  the
mean  free  path,  lambda            = ((1)/ (Sigma         ))  (in  cm)  as
a  function  of  medium  and  energy.  The  energy
binning  is  set  within  the  array  ELOW  (common
/CGMULO/)  in  the  routine  GPHYSI.  The  following
pointers  are  used:



                                                                           th
JMA  =  LQ(JMATE-I)                                     pointer  to  the  I        material
JBREM  =  LQ(JMA-9)                                     pointer  to  bremsstrahlung

JBREM                                                   pointer  for  e-
JBREM+NEK1                                              pointer  for  e+

                                                                            +         -
JBREM+2*NEK1                                            pointer  for  mu       / mu


GBRSGA  is  called  at  initialisation  time  by
GPHYSI.



       VALUE    =    GBRSGE                            (ZZ,T,BCUT)



GBRSGE  calculates  the  total  cross-section  of
bremsstrahlung  of  an  electron  with  kinetic  energy
T  in  material  with  atomic  number  ZZ.  It  is  called
by  GBRSGA.  For  kinetic  energies  which  are  below
the  cut  BCUT  or  for  which  bremsstrahlung  process
is  not  simulated  explicitly  (see  [PHYS341])  it
returns  0.



       VALUE    =    GBFSIG                            (T,C)



GBFSIG  calculates  a  weight  factor  for  the
positron  discrete  (hard)  bremsstrahlung  cross
section.  T  is  the  kinetic  energy  in  GeV  of  the
positron  and  C  is  the  energy  cut  for
bremsstrahlung  (BCUTE).  The  value  returned  is  the
ratio  of  the  positron  bremsstrahlung
cross-section  to  that  of  the  electron  so  that:
<positron  cross-section>  =  GBFSIG  x  <electron
cross-section>.  GBFSIG  is  called  by  GBRSGA.

Let's  call  dsigma         (Z, T, k)/ dk  the  differential
cross-section  for  production  of  a  photon  of
energy  k  by  an  electron  of  kinetic  energy  T  in  the
field  of  an  atom  of  charge  Z,  and  k     the  energy
                                           c

cut-off  below  which  the  soft  photons  are  treated
as  continuous  energy  loss  (BCUTE  in  the  program).
Then  the  mean  value  of  the  energy  lost  by  the
electron  due  to  soft  photons  is



      brem                          k
     E            (Z, T, k   ) = R   c    k((dsigma         (Z, T, k))/ (dk))dk

whereas  the  total  cross-section  for  the  emission
of  a  photon  of  energy  larger  than  k     is
                                          c

 sigma                    (Z, T, k   ) = R        ((dsigma         (Z, T, k))/ (dk))dk
               brem               c

                                                                                                                            (2)
Many  theories  of  the  bremsstrahlung  process
exist,  each  with  its  own  limitations  and  regions
of  applicability.  Perhaps  the  best  synthesis  of
these  theories  can  be  found  in  the  paper  of  S.M.
Seltzer  and  M.J.  Berger  .  The  authors  give  a
tabulation  of  the  bremsstrahlung  cross-section
dsigma         / dk  differential  in  the  photon  energy  k,
for  electrons  with  kinetic  energies  T  from  1  keV
to  10  GeV.  For  electron  energies  above  10  GeV  the



screened  Bethe-Heitler  differential
cross-section  can  be  used    together  with  the
Midgal  corrections  .  The  first  of  the  two  Migdal
corrections  is  important  for  very  high  electron
energies  only  (T> =     1  TeV)  and  has  the  effect  of
reducing  the  cross-section.  The  second  Migdal
correction  is  effective  even  at  ``ordinary''
energies  (100  MeV  --  1  GeV)  and  it  decreases  the
differential  cross-section  at  photon  energies
below  a  certain  fraction  of  the  incident  electron
energy  (dsigma         / dk  decreases  significantly  if

             -4
k/ T< =    10      .)

<H3>Parameterisation  of  energy  loss  and  total
cross-section</H3>


<PRE>


Using  the  tabulated  cross-section  values  of
Seltzer  and  Berger  together  with  the  Migdal
corrected  Bethe-Heitler  formula  we  have  computed
sigma         (Z, T, k   )  and  we  have  used  these  computed
                      c

values  as  ``data  points''  in  the  fitting
procedure.  Calculating  the  ``low  energy''  (T< =    10
GeV)  data  we  have  applied  the  second  Midgal
correction  to  the  results  of  Seltzer  and  Berger.
We  have  chosen  the  parameterisations:

We  have  performed  a  fit  to  the  ``data''  without
the  Midgal  corrections,  too.  In  this  case  we  used
the  data  of  Seltzer  and  Berger  without  any
correction  for  T< =    10  GeV  and  we  used  the
Bethe-Heitler  cross-section  for  T> =    10  GeV.  The
parameterised  forms  of  the  cross-section  and
energy  loss  are  the  same  as  they  were  in  the  first
fit  (i.e.  (??    )  and  (??    )),  only  the  numerical
values  of  the  parameters  have  changed.  These
values  are  in  DATA  statements  in  the  functions
GBRSGE  and  GBRELE  and  this  second  kind  of
parameterisation  can  be  activated  using  the
PATCHY  switch  +USE,BETHE.  (The  two
parameterisations  give  different  results  for
high  electron  energy.)


The  energy  loss  due  to  soft  photon  bremsstrahlung
is  tabulated  at  initialisation  time  as  a  function
of  the  medium  and  of  the  energy  by  routine  GBRELA
(see  JMATE  data  structure).


The  mean  free  path  for  discrete  bremsstrahlung  is
tabuled  at  initialisation  time  as  a  function  of
the  medium  and  of  the  energy  by  routine  GBRSGA
(see  JMATE  data  structure).

Table  0.1:  ratio  of  the  e- / e+  radiative  energy
loss  in  lead  (Z=82).



The  scaling  holds  for  the  ratio  of  the  total
radiative  energy  losses,  but  it  is  significantly
broken  for  the  photon  spectrum  in  the  screened
case.  In  case  of  a  point  Coulomb  charge  the
scaling  would  hold  also  for  the  spectrum.  The
scaling  can  be  expressed  by:



           +               -                        2                                                                              *

If  we  consider  the  photon  spectrum  from

As  in  this  approximation  the  photon  spectra  are
identical,  the  same  SUBROUTINE  is  used  for
generating  e- / e+  bremsstrahlung.  The  following

which  is  consistent  with  the  spectra.


The  effect  of  this  e- / e+  bremsstrahlung
difference  can  be  also  seen  in  e.m.  shower
development,  when  the  primary  energy  is  not  too
high.  An  example  can  be  found  in  table  ??    .
