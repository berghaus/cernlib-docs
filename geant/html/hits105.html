</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Detector  aliases</H2>


<PRE>    Detector  aliases  can  be  specified  for  any
sensitive  detector  for  which  the  user  either
needs  to  store  more  than  one  type  of  hit  or  wants
to  define  additional  detector  entries.



       CALL  GSDETA                         (CHSET,CHDET,CHALI,NWHI,NWDI,IALI*)



CHSET                     (CHARACTER*4)  set  name;
CHDET                     (CHARACTER*4)  name  of  the  detector  for
                          which  an  alias  is  being  defined;
CHALI                     (CHARACTER*4)  alias  name;
NWHI                      (INTEGER)  initial  number  of  words  of
                          HITS  banks;
NWDI                      (INTEGER)  initial  number  of  words  of
                          DIGI  banks;
IALI                      (INTEGER)  position  of  alias  in  bank
                          JS=LQ(JSET-ISET).


Defines  an  alias  CHALI  for  detector  CHDET  of  set
CHSET  and  enters  it  in  the  JSET  structure  as  an
additional  detector  in  the  corresponding  set,  at
the  position  IALI.  The  new  detector  will  be  a  copy
at  position  IALI  of  the  original  detector  CHDET,
with  empty  links  to  the  GSDETH,  GSDETD  and  GSDETU
parameter  banks.  The  user  can  therefore  call
these  three  routines  again  with  the  arguments
appropriate  to  the  detector  CHALI.  Several
aliases  can  be  defined  for  the  same  detector
through  calls  to  GSDETA.
