       CALL  GRAYLI



GRAYLI  computes  the  mean  free  path,  lambda           ,  for
Rayleigh  scattering  as  a  function  of  the  medium
and  of  the  energy.  It  evaluates  also  an  integral
of  atomic  form  factors  which  is  used  in  the
routine  GRAYL  (see  [PHYS251])  to  sample  the
scattering  angles.  GRAYLI  is  called  during
initialization  by  GPHYSI.

<H3>Total  cross-section</H3>


<PRE>


An  empirical  cross-section  is  used  to  produce  the
total  cross-section  data  :


                              3       2
  sigma            (Z, E) = aE    + bE    + cE + d                   barn/atom                                              (1)
                c


The  values  of  the  coefficients  are  stored  in  the
DATA  statement  within  the  routine  GRAYLI.  For
each  element  the  fit  was  obtained  over  27
experimental  values  of  the  total  coherent
cross-section.  The  accuracy  of  the  fit  is



estimated  to  be  about  Delta         sigma         / sigma          ss 10%,  but
it  is  better  for  most  of  the  elements.

<H3>The  atomic  form  factors</H3>


<PRE>


Different  empirical  formulae  are  used  to  produce
the  atomic  form  factor  F(Z,E)  data  .  For
Z = 1- 3, 91- 99  the  empirical  expression  is:


               7          6          5          4          3          2
F(Z, E) = a   E    + b   E    + c   E    + d   E    + e   E    + f   E    + g   E + h
           1          1          1          1          1          1          1       1

                                                                                                                            (2)
for  Z=100  the  formula  used  is:


                         5          4          3          2
          F(Z, E) = a   E    + b   E    + c   E    + d   E    + e   E + f                                                   (3)
                     2          2          2          2          2       2


for  the  other  elements  F  is  calculated  as:


                        3          2
                   a   E    + b   E    + c   E + d                            if     E< =    E

    F(Z, E) = -     3   3      3   2      3       3                                           c         .                   (4)

                   a   E    + b   E    + c   E + d                            if     E>E
                    4          4          4       4                                     c


The  value  of  the  energy  E     depends  on  Z  and  it  is
                              c

set  in  the  array  ELIM.  The  values  of  the
coefficients  are  stored  in  the  DATA  statement  in
the  routine  GRAYLI.  For  each  element  the  fits
were  performed  over  97  tabulated  values  of  the
form  factors.  The  accuracy  of  the  fit  is
estimated  to  about  Delta         sigma         / sigma          = 10%  for
E< =    1  MeV  for  most  of  the  elements.  The  integral
over  the  atomic  form  factors  A(E   )  is  defined  as
                                     i

follows:


                       E                         2           E                         2    2

        A(E   ) = 2 R   i    _F   (E)_              EdE = R   i    _F   (E)_              dE                                (5)
           i                   T                                     T

                       0                                     0


where  F   (E)  is  the  total  atomic  form  factor  which
        T

is  function  of  the  energy  E.
