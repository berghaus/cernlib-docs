       CALL  GSRUNG                         (NUBUF,UBUF,IADR*)



NUBUF                     (INTEGER)  number  of  user  words;
UBUF                      (REAL)  array  of  user  words;
IADR                      (INTEGER)  position  where  information  is
                          stored  in  the  user  bank  of  the  JRUNG
                          structure.


This  routine  stores  the  first  NUBUF  words  of
array  BUF  in  the  user  bank  attached  to  the
structure  JRUNG  (see  [BASE299]),  starting  at
location  IADR+1.  On  exit  IADR  is  set  to
IADR+NUBUF,  allowing  subsequent  filling.  This
allows  effectively  to  add  information  to  the
current  JRUNG  bank,  whether  or  not  it  has  already
an  user  buffer.



       CALL  GFRUNG                         (NWRUNG*,IRUNG*,NUBUF*,UBUF*)



NWRUNG                    (INTEGER)  number  of  words  in  JRUNG  bank;
IRUNG                     (REAL)  content  of  JRUNG  bank;
NUBUF                     (INTEGER)  number  of  user  words;
UBUF                      (REAL)  array  of  user  words;


This  routine  retrieves  the  content  of  the  JRUNG
bank  and  of  the  user  information  added,  if  any.



       CALL  GPRUNG



This  routine  prints  the  content  of  the  JRUNG  bank
and  of  the  user  information  added,  if  any.



       CALL  GSHEAD                         (NUBUF,UBUF,IADR*)



NUBUF                     (INTEGER)  number  of  user  words;
UBUF                      (REAL)  array  of  user  words;
IADR                      (INTEGER)  position  where  information  is
                          stored  in  the  user  bank  of  the  JHEAD
                          structure.


This  routine  stores  the  first  NUBUF  words  of
array  BUF  in  the  user  bank  attached  to  the
structure  JHEAD  (see  [BASE299]),  starting  at
location  IADR+1.  On  exit  IADR  is  set  to
IADR+NUBUF,  allowing  subsequent  filling.  This
allows  effectively  to  add  information  to  the
current  JHEAD  bank,  whether  or  not  it  has  already
an  user  buffer.



       CALL  GFHEAD                         (NWHEAD*,IHEAD*,NUBUF*,UBUF*)



NWHEAD                    (INTEGER)  number  of  words  in  JHEAD  bank;
IHEAD                     (REAL)  content  of  JHEAD  bank;
NUBUF                     (INTEGER)  number  of  user  words;
UBUF                      (REAL)  array  of  user  words;


This  routine  retrieves  the  content  of  the  JHEAD
bank  and  of  the  user  information  added,  if  any.



       CALL  GPHEAD



This  routine  prints  the  content  of  the  JHEAD  bank
and  of  the  user  information  added,  if  any.
