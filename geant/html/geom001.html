 </PRE>  <HR>  <H2>The  geometry  package</H2>


 <PRE>


 The  geometry  package  has  two  main  functions:


1.      define,  during  the  initialisation  of  the
        program,  the  geometry  in  which  the  particles
        will  be  tracked;
2.      communicate,  during  the  event  processing
        phase,  to  the  tracking  routines  the
        information  for  the  transport  of  the  particles
        in  the  geometry  which  has  been  defined.


 The  present  section  reviews  the  concepts  of  the
 geometry  package  and  explains  how  the  geometrical
 information  should  be  provided  by  the  user.  It  is
 important  to  point  out  that,  once  the  geometry
 has  been  defined,  the  tracking  of  particles
 through  the  different  volumes  proceeds  without
 any  intervention  from  the  user  [TRAK].


 The  connection  between  the  geometry  and  tracking
 packages  is  established  by  the  subroutines
 GMEDIA/GTMEDI,  GTNEXT/GNEXT  and  GINVOL  which
 answer  respectively  the  questions:


    *   In  which  volume  is  a  given  point  ?
    *   What  is  the  distance  to  the  nearest  volume
        along  the  trajectory  of  the  particle  ?
    *   What  is  the  distance  to  the  nearest  volume  ?
    *   Is  a  given  point  still  in  the  current  volume  ?


 The  routines  GTMEDI,  GTNEXT  are  used  in  a  dynamic
 context,  at  tracking  time,  when  the  knowledge  of
 the  track  direction  can  be  used  to  save  time.

 <H2>  The  volume  definition  </H2>


 <PRE>


 Experimental  setups,  as  complex  as  the  LEP(The
 Large  Electron  Positron  collider  in  operation  at
 CERN.)  detectors,  can  be  described  rather
 accurately  through  the  definition  of  a  set  of
 volumes.  Each  volume  is  given  a  name  and  is



characterised  by:


   *   a  shape  identifier,  specifying  one  of  the  basic
       geometrical  shapes  available  [GEOM050];
   *   the  shape  parameters,  giving  the  dimensions  of
       the  volume;
   *   a  local  reference  system,  with  origin  and  axes
       defined  for  the  each  shape;
   *   the  physical  properties,  given  by  a  set  of
       constants  describing  the  homogeneous  material
       which  fills  the  volume  ([CONS]);
   *   additional  properties,  known  as  tracking
       medium  parameters,  which  depend  on  the
       characteristics  of  the  volume  itself  (the
       material  identifier  is  one  of  the  constants)
       and  on  its  geometrical  and  physical
       environment  (properties  of  the  neighbouring
       volumes,  magnetic  field,  etc.)  [CONS,  TRAK];
   *   a  set  of  attributes,  in  connection  with  the
       drawing  package  and  the  detector  response
       package  [DRAW,  HITS].


Until  it  is  positioned  in  a  given  reference
frame,  a  volume  is  an  entity  which  has  no  spatial
relation  with  the  other  volumes.  By  convention,  a
unique  initial  volume  has  to  be  defined  first
which  will  contain  all  the  other  volumes.  The
reference  frame  intrinsic  to  this  volume  is
considered  to  be  the  master  reference  frame.


There  are  sixteen  basic  shapes  in  GEANT,  which
are  described  in  [GEOM050].


</PRE>


<H2>Volumes  with  contents</H2>


<PRE>


A  volume  can  be  declared  to  have  contents  and  as
such  it  becomes  a  mother  volume.  The  contents  are
either  predefined  volumes  which  are  explicitly
positioned  inside  the  mother,  or  new  volumes
which  are  implicitly  defined  by  a  division
mechanism  applied  to  the  mother.  Positioning  a
volume  with  given  shape  and  dimensions  inside  a
mother  volume  is  obtained  by  specifying  its
translation  and  rotation  with  respect  to  the
mother  reference  frame.  The  user  should  make  sure
that  no  volume  extends  beyond  the  boundaries  of
its  mother.


When  a  volume  is  positioned,  the  user  gives  it  a
number.  Multiple  copies  of  the  same  volume  can  be
positioned  inside  the  same  or  different  mothers
as  long  as  their  copy  numbers  differ.  The



contents  of  the  positioned  volume  are  reproduced
in  all  copies.


Mother  volumes  can  be  divided  by  planes  along  the
three  axes  (x, y, z),  radially  along  R      ,  or  along
                                           xy

the  spherical  coordinates  of  a  polar  system:  R,
theta           and  phi     .  The  axis  along  which  it  is  possible
to  perform  a  division  depend  on  the  shape  to  be
divided.  The  general  rule  is  that  the  result  of
the  division  be  still  a  GEANT  shape.


A  volume  can  be  partially  or  totally  divided.  The
division  process  generates  a  number  of  cells,
which  are  considered  as  new  volumes.  The  cell
dimensions  are  computed  according  to  the  number
of  divisions  or  the  step  size.  A  cell,  as  any
other  volume,  can  again  be  divided,  or  have  other
volumes  positioned  into  it.  Any  operation  of
positioning  or  division  performed  on  one  cell  is
repeated  to  all  the  cells  resulting  from  the
division.  A  volume  can  be  either  divided  or  have
contents,  but  not  the  two  things  together.


These  operations  define  a  physical  tree  with
several  levels.  The  material  and  properties  of
the  contents  replace  the  ones  of  the  mother
within  the  space  region  they  occupy.  A  volume  is
therefore  defined  not  only  by  its  intrinsic
characteristics  but  also  by  those  of  its
descendants,  namely  its  contents  (by  division  or
positioning),  the  contents  of  its  contents,  etc.


</PRE>


<H2>  Overlapping  volumes,  see  also  [GEOM020]
</H2>


<PRE>


The  user  may  define  volumes  which  have  no
relation  with  the  real  objects.  It  is  sometimes
convenient  to  make  use  of  such  volumes,  to
artificially  delimit  regions  with  simple  shapes.
Doing  this,  it  may  happen  that  volumes  partially
overlap  each  other.  (A  volume  positioned  inside  a
mother  is  obviously  not  regarded  as  overlapping
the  mother).


It  is  possible  in  GEANT  to  handle  partially
overlapping  volumes,  but  there  are  some
implications  that  the  user  should  be  aware  of.  A
flag  'ONLY'/'MANY'  is  assigned  to  each  copy  of  a
given  volume  at  the  moment  this  is  positioned.
The  'MANY'  option  indicates  that  a  point  found  in
this  volume  could  also  be  in  other  volumes  which



are  not  its  direct  descendants.  If  one  of  the
overlapping  volumes  where  the  point  is  found  is
declared  as  'ONLY',  the  geometry  subroutines  will
give  priority  to  this  volume,  and  the  search
stops.  If  a  point  is  inside  several  'MANY'
volumes  and  outside  all  'ONLY'  ones,  priority
will  be  given  to  the  volume  found  at  the  deepest
level,  or  to  the  first  found,  if  there  are  many
valid  'MANY'  candidates  at  the  same  level.  In
order  to  avoid  ambiguities,  two  overlapping
'MANY'  volumes  should  in  general  have  the  same
tracking  medium.

<H2>The  physical  tree</H2>


<PRE>


An  example  of  a  4  level  physical  tree  with
embedded  volumes  and  the  corresponding
geometrical  configuration  are  shown  in  fig  ??    .


 <A  HREF=  "  file=eps/geom001-1.eps,width=16cm  "  >
                              PS  picture  (click  here)</A>


   Figure  1:  Example  of  geometrical  tree  structure



where  A  and  B  are  BOXes,  C  a  TRAPezoid,  and  D  and  E
TUBEs  (see  [GEOM050]  for  more  detail).  Notice
that  the  same  physical  configuration  could  be
described  as  well  though  a  3  level  tree  if  D  were
defined  as  a  hollow  TUBE,  with  inner  radius
non-zero  and  E  directly  positioned  into  B.  The
package  accepts  a  maximum  of  15  levels,  which
should  be  enough  to  represent  the  fine  details  of
a  complex  structure.


</PRE>


<H2>The  data  structures  JVOLUM  and  JGPAR  and  the
common  /GCVOLU/</H2>


<PRE>


In  practice,  the  physical  tree  is  not  represented
as  such  in  the  data  part  of  the  program.  Instead,
a  logical  tree  structure  is  defined,  the  JVOLUM
data  structure,  which  describes  the  arrangement
of  volumes  in  a  compact  and  recurrent  way.  Each
generic  volume  appears  once,  and  once  only,  and
carries  the  information  relevant  to  the  volume
itself  and  to  its  contents,  if  any,  by  reference
to  the  generic  volumes  corresponding  to  those
contents.  In  the  situation  where  division  or
multiple  copies  occur,  there  is  no  longer  a



one-to-one  correspondence  between  a  volume  in  the
logical  tree  and  a  region  in  space.  Information
has  to  be  added  at  tracking  time  to  identify  which
division  cell  or  which  copy  was  considered  at
each  depth  level  along  the  path  through  the
physical  tree.  This  information  is  stored  by  the
subroutine  GMEDIA/GTMEDI,  for  the  current  point
of  the  current  track,  in  the  common  /GCVOLU/.  It
includes  the  current  level  number  NLEVEL  and,  for
each  level,  starting  from  the  first  mother
volume,  the  identification  of  the  corresponding
volume,  e.g.:  NAME,  NUMBER,  'ONLY'/'MANY'  flag,
translation  and  rotation  with  respect  to  the
master  reference  frame  and  so  on.  The  number  of
shape  parameters  and  pointers  to  the  vector
describing  the  actual  values  of  those  parameters,
for  each  level,  are  stored  in  the  data  part  and  in
the  link  part,  of  the  data  structure  JGPAR,
respectively.

<H2>The  user  tools  </H2>


<PRE>


The  geometry  through  which  the  particles  are
transported  is  defined  by  the  user  via  a  set  of
calls  to  subroutines  of  the  GEANT  package.


The  user  can  define  a  volume  through  a  call  to  the
subroutine:


GSVOLU                    define  (instantiate)  a  volume  by  giving
                          a  NAME  and  the  actual  parameters  to  a
                          shape;  the  position  of  the  volume  inside
                          the  bank  JVOLUM  is  returned.  If  any  of
                          the  parameters  which  express  a  length  is
                          negative,  GEANT  will  assign  to  this
                          parameter  at  tracking  time  the  maximum
                          value  allowed,  without  protruding  out
                          of  the  mother  which  contains  the
                          particle  transported.
                          A  shape  can  be  instantiated  into  a
                          volume  also  without  actual  parameters.
                          These  will  then  be  supplied  when
                          positioning  each  copy  of  the  volume  via
                          the  GSPOSP  routine  (see  below).  This
                          allows  to  have  many  similar  volumes  with
                          the  same  name  and  shape,  but  different
                          actual  parameters  in  each  copy.


The  user  can  position  a  volume  through  a  call  to
either  one  of  the  following  subroutines:



GSPOS                     position  a  copy  of  a  volume  inside  its
                          mother  with  respect  to  the  mother's
                          reference  system.  A  a  point  in  space,  a
                          rotation  matrix  index,  a  copy  number  and
                          the  'ONLY'/'MANY'  flag  are  supplied;
GSPOSP                    position  a  copy  of  a  volume  which  has
                          been  instantiated  without  actual
                          parameters  inside  its  mother  with
                          respect  to  the  mother  reference  system.
                          The  parameters  of  the  copy  being
                          positioned  are  supplied  as  well.  The
                          volumes  will  be  identified  by  name  and
                          copy  number  as  for  multiple  copies  of
                          the  same  volume.


The  user  can  divide  a  volume  through  a  call  to
either  one  of  the  following  subroutines:


GSDVN                  divide  a  volume  in  a  given  number  of
                       cells  completely  filling  the  mother.  In
                       this  case  the  cell  tracking  medium  is
                       assumed  to  be  the  same  as  for  the  mother.
                       See  also  GSDVN2.
GSDVT                  divide  a  volume  with  slices  of  a  given
                       step.  The  cell  tracking  medium  can  be
                       different  from  the  one  of  the  mother.  See
                       also  GSDVT2.
GSDVX                  divide  a  volume  starting  from  a  given
                       offset.  In  addition  to  STEP  and  NDIV
                       (with  at  least  one  of  them  positive  to  be
                       effectively  useful),  the  origin  of  the
                       first  cell,  the  cell  tracking  medium  and
                       eventually  the  computed  (maximum)  number
                       of  divisions  must  be  specified.


</PRE>


<H2>Geometrical  information  retrieval</H2>


<PRE>


The  parameters  of  a  volume  may  depend  on  the
physical  tree  which  leads  to  this  volume.  The
dimensions  of  one  of  the  slices  of  a  cone  divided
along  Z  depends  on  which  slice  we  consider.  So  a
volume  is  completely  defined  only  if  we  specify
the  path  in  the  tree.  This  is  composed  by  the  name
and  copy  number  of  the  volumes  containing  the  one
we  are  interested  in,  from  the  first  mother.


Given  this  information,  the  routine  GLVOLU  is
capable  to  fill  the  common  /GCVOLU/,  and  the
structure  JGPAR  with  the  actual  parameters  of  the
instance  chosen.
