       CALL  GBRELA



GBRELA  fills  the  tables  for  continuous  energy
loss  of  electrons,  positrons  and  muons  due  to
bremsstrahlung  during  initialisation  time.  The
energy  binning  is  determined  by  the  array  ELOW
(common  /CGMULO/)  in  the  routine  GPHYSI.  In  the
tables,  the  dE/ dx  due  to  bremsstrahlung  is  summed
with  that  due  to  the  ionisation.  For  energy  loss
of  muons,  GBRELA  calls  the  function  GDRELM.  The
following  pointers  are  used:



                                                                         th
JMA  =  LQ(JMATE-I)                                   pointer  to  the  I        material;
JEL1  =  LQ(JMA-1)                                    pointer  to  dE/dx  for
                                                      electrons;
JEL1+NEK1                                             pointer  to  dE/dx  for
                                                      positrons;
JEL2  =  LQ(JMA-2)                                    pointer  to  dE/dx  for
                                                      electrons.


GBRELA  is  called  by  GPHYSI.



       VALUE    =    GBRELM                            (Z,T,BCUT)



Z                         (REAL)  atomic  number  of  the  material;
T                         (REAL)  kinetic  energy  of  the  muon;
BCUT                      (REAL)  soft  bremsstrahlung  cut.



GBRELM  calculates  the  muon  energy  loss  due  to
bremsstrahlung  of  photons  with  energy  below  BCUT,
(variable  BCUTM  in  the  common  /GCCUTS/).  Above
this  value,  the  bremsstrahlung  process  is
simulated  explicitly  (see  [PHYS441])  and  the
energy  lost  by  the  muons  is  not  included  in  the
tables.  In  the  tables,  the  dE/ dx  due  to
bremsstrahlung  is  summed  with  the  energy  lost
coming  from  ionisation,  pair  production  and
nuclear  interaction.  GBRELM  is  called  by  GBRELA.



       CALL  GBRSGA



GBRSGA  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for
bremsstrahlung.  It  tabulates  the  mean  free  path
in  cm  as  a  function  of  the  medium  and  the  energy.
The  energy  binning  is  determined  by  the  array
ELOW  (common  /CGMULO/).  The  following  pointers
are  used:



                                                                         th
JMA  =  LQ(JMATE-I)                                   pointer  to  the  I        material;
JBREM  =  LQ(JMA-9)                                   pointer  to  bremsstrahlung
                                                      cross-sections;
JBREM                                                 pointer  for  e-;
JBREM+NEK1                                            pointer  for  e+;

                                                                          +         -

GBRSGA  is  called  during  initialisation  by  GPHYSI.

Z                         (REAL)  atomic  number  of  the  materian;
T                         (REAL)  kinetic  energy  of  the  muon;
BCUT                      (REAL)  soft  bremsstrahlung  cut.


GBRSGM  calculates  the  total  bremsstrahlung
cross-section  for  muons  when  the  emitted  photon
has  an  energy  greater  than  BCUT,  (variable  BCUTM
in  the  common  /GCCUTS/).  It  is  called  by  GBRSGA.
