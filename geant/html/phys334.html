       CALL  GSTINI



GSTINI  initializes  the  tables  that  are  used  for
sampling  of  the  energy  loss,  if  the  user  has  set
the  flag  STRA  =  1.  It  calls  the  subroutine  GSTXIN
to  integrate  an  expression  for  the  number  of
collisions  and  GSTTAB  for  preparing  the  tables
for  different  Lorentz  factors.  It  is  called  from
GPHYSI  at  initialization  time.



       CALL  GSTXIN



GSTXIN  computes  the  values  needed  for  the
sampling  tables.  It  uses  the  functions  GOSCIN  to
integrate  over  the  photoelectric  cross-sections
and  the  function  GKOKRI  to  compute  the  real  part
of  the  complex  dielectric  constant.  GSTXIN  is
called  from  GSTINI.



       VALUE    =    GOSCIN                            (EIN1EV,EIN2EV)



GOSCIN  integrates  the  parameterization  of  the
photoelectric  cross-sections  from  energy  EIN1EV
to  energy  EIN2EV.  It  is  called  from  GSTXIN.



       VALUE    =    GKOKRI                            (E,EMINEV,EMAXEV)



GKOKRI  computes  the  real  part  of  the  complex
dieletric  constant  which  is  needed  in  the
preparation  of  energy  loss  sampling  tables.  E  in
the  energy  for  which  the  values  are  being
tabulated,  EMINEV  and  EMAXEV  are  the  integration
limits.  GKOKRI  is  called  from  GSTXIN.



       CALL  GSTTAB                         (GAM,NT,EN,FN)



GSTTAB  prepares  the  energy  loss  sampling  tables
for  different  Lorentz  factors.  The  input  GAM  is
the  Lorentz  factor,  the  output  values  are:  NT  the
lenght  of  the  table,  EN  the  energy  array  and  FN
the  cumulative  probabilty  array.  It  calls  GXGINT
to  integrate  over  the  probability  function  GSTDN
to  get  the  value  of  FN.  GSTTAB  is  called  from
GSTINI.



       VALUE    =    GXGINT                            (EXT,A,B,EPS)



GXGINT  performs  the  Gaussian  integration  from  A
to  B  over  the  function  EXT  with  accuracy  EPS.  It
is  called  from  GSTTAB  to  integrate  over  the
probability  function  GSTDN.



       VALUE    =    GSTDN                          (LGE)



GSTDN  is  the  function  which  gives  the  probability
for  a  collision  with  energy  transfer  LGE.  It  is
integrated  to  get  the  cumulative  probabilty
function  to  be  used  in  the  sampling  of  the  energy
loss.



       CALL  GSTREN                         (GAMMA,ECUT,STEP)



GSTREN  computes  the  energy  loss  for  a  particle  of
Lorentz  factor  GAMMA  in  a  step  of  length  STEP  if
the  user  has  set  the  flag  STRA  =  1.  ECUT  is  the  cut
for  the  delta         -ray  production.  GSTREN  is  called
from  GFLUCT.

<H2>The  method</H2>



<PRE>


In  thin  layers,  the  Landau  model  of  energy  loss
fluctuations  is  not  valid,  because  the  number  of
collisions  is  too  small.  In  this  case,  the  atomic
structure  of  the  atom  has  to  be  taken  into
account.  The  photoabsorption  ionization  (PAI)
model  uses  the  photoelectric  cross-sections  to
describe  the  energy  loss  distribution.  The
results  (the  width  and  the  most  probable  value  of
the  energy  loss  distribution  function)  given  by
this  model  are  equal  to  those  given  by  standard
GEANT  procedure  described  in  [PHYS332].  In
addition,  however,  it  gives  an  estimate  of  the
number  of  collision  in  each  step  (NICOLL  in  the
common  block  GCSTRA).  PAI  model  is  slower  than
the  standard  GEANT  method.


PAI  model  is  activated,  if  the  user  set  the  flag
STRA  =  1.  The  default  value  is  0.

<H3>The  photoabsorption  ionization  model</H3>


<PRE>


An  expression  for  the  distribution  of  energy  loss
can  be  derived  considering  the  energy  loss  as  the
sum  of  the  energy  transfers  in  the
electromagnetic  interactions  between  the
particle  and  the  atom.  As  the  interaction  is
small  (i.e.  the  energy  transfer  is  small  compared
to  the  energy  of  the  passing  particle),  Born
approximation  can  be  used  in  the  perturbation
theory.  In  the  derivation,  the  atomic  transition
current  is  considered  as  a  sum  of  the  transition
currents  of  its  electrons.


varepsilon                    is  the  complex  dielectric  constant  of
a  medium  which  describes  the  electromagnetic
properties  of  the  medium  and  thus  the  effect  of
the  field  of  an  atom  on  the  energy  loss  of  the
particle.


The  complex  dielectric  constant  can  be  written
varepsilon                   = varepsilon                      + ivarepsilon                       where
                                                           1                                  2

varepsilon                       describes  the  polarization  and

varepsilon                       the  absorptive  properties  of  the
                            2

medium.  varepsilon                       can  be  expressed  with  the
                                     2

help  of  the  oscillator  strength  function



f(k, omega         )  which  describes  the  coupling  of  the
electrons  to  the  field  of  the  atom.

m  is  the  mass  of  the  electron  and  N  is  the  electron
density.  In  a  simplified  model,  the
photoabsorption  cross-section  sigma                       (omega         )
                                              gamma

can  be  used  for  description  of  f(k, omega         ):

Z  being  the  atomic  number  of  the  medium.  The  real
part  of  varepsilon                    can  be  expressed  as  an
integral  of  the  imaginary  part  according  to  the
Kronig's  and  Kramers'  dispersion  relation:

<H3>Implementation</H3>


<PRE>


A  photoabsorption  ionization  Monte  Carlo  code
provided  to  us  by  users  has  been  implemented  in
GEANT.  Tables  are  prepared  at  initialization  time
and  sampling  from  these  tables  is  done  each  step
at  running  time.  An  important  thing  to  note  is  the
dependence  of  the  (dN/ dx)        on  the  photoelectric
                             >E

cross-sections  which,  when  taken  from  different
sources,  may  differ  considerably,  especially  at
low  energies.


To  fill  the  tables,  the  integration  of  equation
??      has  to  be  done.  Before  the  integration  over  the
energy,  the  integral  over  the  oscillator  strength
function  f(k, omega         )  sigma                       (omega         )  (last
                                              gamma

term  in  equation  ??    )  and  the  dielectric  constant
(equations  ??     and  ??    )  varepsilon                    have  to  be
computed.  These  integaration  can  be  done
analytically  when  the  parameterized
cross-sections  are  used.


The  oscillator  strength  function  should  fulfill
the  Bethe  sum  rule  :


                                        1
                                     R     f(k, omega         )domega          = 1                                          (7)


                                        0


To  respect  this  condition,  in  the  PAI  model,  one
has  to  add  some  contribution  from  the  excitation
processes  to  low-energy  region  of  the
photoelectric  cross-sections  .  In  GEANT,  the
photoelectric  cross-section  parameterization  of
the  Sandia    report  is  used.  In  order  not  to  change
the  tabulated  parameterization,  the  sum  rule  is

cross-section  of  the  gas  mixture  70%  Xe  -  10%
CO     -  20%  CF     for  two  different  data  sets.  The
  2              4

low  energy  limit  of  the  cross-sections  from  the
Sandia  data  in  chosen  to  be  11  eV.  In  the  figure
below,  the  low  energy  limit  is  the  ionization
limit  for  each  component  of  the  mixture



taken  into  account  by  lowering  the  energy  limit
for  the  integration  below  the  ionization  limit.
This  will  not  satisy  the  equation  ??     in  all  cases.
In  the  program,  however,  the  Bethe  sum  rule  is
forced  by  dividing  the  integrated  cross-section
from  E  to  1  by  the  value  given  by  the  integration
over  the  whole  range.  In  figure  ??    ,  the
integrated  cross-section  (oscillator  strength

given  for  two  different  sets  of  photoelectric
cross-section  data  for  a  gas  mixture  70%  Xe  -  10%
CO     -  20%  CF   .  In  the  figure  below,  the  continuous
  2              4

line  is  the  result  of  the  integration  tabulated
from       and  the  dashed  line  is  from  the  integration
of  GEANT  cross-sections  considering  the  lower
limit  of  the  cross-section  the  ionization  energy
(12.3  eV  for  Xe,  11.26  eV  for  C,  13.6  for  O,  and
17.42  for  F).  In  the  figure  above,  the  continuous
line  is  as  before,  but  for  the  dashed  line,  the
lower  limit  of  the  cross-sections  is  considered
to  be  11  eV  for  all  elements  of  the  mixture  to
compensate  for  the  sum  rule.


The  imaginary  part  of  the  complex  dielectric
constant  can  then  be  computed  from  the  integrated
cross-section.  To  compute  the  real  part  of
varepsilon                  ,  one  needs  to  take  the  Cauchy
principal  value  which  is  basically  a  limiting
process  cancelling  the  two  infinite  contribution
around  the  pole  (x   - delta         , x    + delta         ).  The
                     0                     0

derivation  of  the  real  part  with  the  Sandia
parametrization  is  shown  in  detail  in  the
appendix.

and  the  integrated  cross-section,  the

the  initialization  time  in  subroutine  GSTINI.  The
value  of  energy  loss  is  sampled  from  these  tables
in  subroutine  GSTREN.


One  should  remember  the  dependence  of  this  method
on  the  photoelectric  cross  section  data.  Figure
??      shows  the  results  for  the  two  different  data
sets.  The  difference  in  the  low-energy  part  is
very  significative  as  the  sampling  is  done  from
these  tables  and,  according  the  inverse
transverse  method,  the  number  of  collisions  is
sampled  between  the  maximum  and  minimum  of  the
curves  in  figure  ??    .
