<H2>Introduction</H2>


<PRE>


The  setup  where  the  particles  are  transported  is
represented  by  a  structure  of  geometrical
volumes.  Each  volume  is  filled  with  matter  (which
can  have  the  properties  of  the  vacuum  in  case  of
it  contains  no  matter).


The  matter  composing  the  volumes  is  described  via
two  sets  of  attributes.  The  first  set  is  relative
to  the  nature  of  the  material  composing  the
volume,  and  contains  information  such  as  the
atomic  number,  the  atomic  weight,  the  density  and
so  on  (see  the  description  of  the  routine  GSMATE
in  this  section  for  more  information).


The  second  set  of  attributes  is  relevant  to  the
process  of  particle  transport  and  they  define  a
so-called  tracking  medium.  These  are  parameters
such  as  the  material  composing  the  volume,  the
magnetic  field,  the  required  tracking  precision,
the  maximum  energy  that  can  be  lost  in  one  step
and  so  on  (see  the  description  of  the  routine
GSTMED  in  this  section  for  more  information).


Each  tracking  medium  refers  to  a  material  via  a
material  number  which  is  assigned  by  the  user.
Different  tracking  media  can,  with  some
limitation,  refer  to  the  same  material.


Each  volume  is  filled  by  a  tracking  medium
identified  by  a  medium  number.  Different  volumes
may  have  the  same  medium  number  (see  [GEOM]).


The  transport  of  particles  through  a  setup
([TRAK])  requires  access  to  data  which  describe:


   *   the  geometry  of  the  setup;
   *   the  material  and  tracking  medium  parameters;



   *   the  particle  properties.


The  section  [CONS]  contains  the  routines  for  the
storage  and  retrieval  of  information  related  to
materials,  tracking  media  and  the  particles.


Important  note:  many  entities  in  GEANT  are
user-defined  via  a  subroutine  call.  One  of  the
arguments  of  this  subroutine  is  a  integer  number
which  identifies  the  entity.  Examples  are
materials,  tracking  media,  particles  and  so  on.
It  can  be  tempting,  for  booking  purposes,  to  use
very  large  numbers.  For  instance,  in  a  large
detector,  the  number  of  all  the  materials  in  the
hadronic  calorimeter  could  be  1001< =    I< =    2000.
Even  if  these  conventions  are  very  handy,  they
can  introduce  a  performance  penalty.


For  reasons  of  speed,  the  number  provided  by  the
user  is  used  directly  as  the  number  of  the  link  in
the  ZEBRA  data  structure  indicating  where  to
store  the  pointer  to  the  bank  containing  the
information  on  the  entity.  ZEBRA  pointers  are
contiguous.  Defining  an  object  with  a  user  number
of  1000  forces  ZEBRA  to  allow  space  for  1000
links.  This  entails  a  loss  of  space  (999  words),
but  much  worse  than  that,  induces  ZEBRA  to
believe  that  there  are  in  fact  999  more  banks.  At
every  operation  which  causes  a  relocation  of
banks,  ZEBRA  will  check  all  the  possible  links,
which  can  be  very  time  consuming.


So  values  of  user-defined  entities  must  be  kept
as  small  as  possible  and  contiguous.  In  large
applications  one  could  write  a  routine  which
returns  the  next  free  number  to  be  allocated,
which  can  then  be  stored  in  a  variable  and  always
referenced  symbolically,  freeing  the  user  from
the  need  to  define  ranges.  As  an  example  we  give
here  a  function  performing  this  operation  for  the
material  number:
           FUNCTION  NEXTMA()
+SEQ,  GCBANK
           IF(JMATE.LE.0)  THEN
                NEXTMA  =  1
           ELSE
                DO  10  IMAT  =  1,  IQ(JMATE-2)
                      IF(LQ(JMATE-IMAT).EQ.0)  GOTO  20
    10         CONTINUE
    20         NEXTMA  =  IMAT
           ENDIF
           END

<H2>Materials</H2>



<PRE>


The  material  constants  are  stored  in  the  data
structure  JMATE  via  the  routine  GSMATE  and  can  be
retrieved  via  the  routine  GFMATE  and  printed  via
the  routine  GPMATE.  The  routine  GMATE  calls
repeatedly  the  routine  GSMATE  to  define  a
standard  set  of  materials,  but  its  use  is  not
mandatory.  Mixtures  of  basic  materials,
compounds  or  molecules  with  atoms  from  different
basic  materials,  may  also  be  defined  and  their
characteristics  are  stored  in  the  structure
JMATE,  through  calls  to  the  routine  GSMIXT.
Mixtures  of  compounds  are  allowed.


Quantities  such  as  energy  loss  and  cross-section
tables  (see  [PHYS]),  computed  during  the
initialisation  of  the  program  are  stored  in  the
structure  JMATE.  These  can  be  accessed  through
the  routine  GFTMAT  and  plotted  or  printed  through
the  routines  GPLMAT  and  GPRMAT  respectively.

<H2>Tracking  media</H2>


<PRE>


The  tracking  medium  parameters  are  stored  in  the
data  structure  JTMED  by  the  routine  GSTMED.
Details  about  these  parameters  are  given  in
[TRAK].  They  can  be  accessed  with  the  routine
GFTMED  and  printed  with  the  routine  GPTMED.


The  correctness  of  the  transport  process  and  thus
the  reliability  of  the  results  obtained  with
GEANT  depend  critically  on  the  values  of  the
tracking  medium  parameters.  To  help  the  user,
most  of  the  parameters  are  recalculated  by
default  by  GEANT  irrespective  of  the  value
assigned  by  the  user.  Advanced  users  can  control
the  value  of  the  parameters  thus  bypassing  the
automatic  computation.  See  the  description  of  the
routine  GSTMED  for  more  information.


The  tracking  thresholds,  and  other  parameters  and
flags  that  control  the  physics  processes,  defined
in  GINIT  and  possibly  modified  through  the
relevant  data  records,  are  also  stored  in  the
structure  JTMED.  These  parameters  can  be
redefined  for  each  tracking  medium  via  the
routine  GSTPAR.

<H2>Particles</H2>



<PRE>


The  parameters  of  the  particles  transported  by
GEANT  are  stored  in  the  data  structure  JPART  via
the  routine  GSPART.  The  decay  properties  of
particles  are  defined  via  the  routine  GSDK.  The
particle  constants  can  be  accessed  with  the
routine  GFPART  and  printed  with  the  routine
GPPART.


The  routine  GPART  defines  the  standard  table  of
particles,  branching  ratios  and  decay  modes.  This
routine  needs  to  be  called  for  the  GEANT  system  to
work  properly.  GPART  calls  the  routine  GSPART  for
the  particle  properties  and  GSDK  for  the  decays
for  each  particle  in  the  standard  GEANT  table.
The  user  may  call  GSPART  and  GSDK  to  extend  or
modify  the  table  defined  by  GPART.
