       CALL  GRAYL



GRAYL  generates  Rayleigh  scattering  of  a  photon
using  the  random-number  composition  and
rejection  technique  to  sample  the  momentum  of  the
scattered  photon  and  the  scattering  angle,
according  to  the  form-factor  distribution.  In
this  reaction  no  new  particles  are  generated  and
the  kinematical  quantities  of  the  scattered
photon  replace  the  original  ones  in  the  /GCTRAK/
common  block.


Activation  of  the  Rayleigh  scattering  is  done  via
the  FFREAD  data  record  RAYL.  If  this  process  is
activated,  GRAYL  is  called  by  GTGAMA  when  a
Rayleigh  scattering  occurs.

 Therefore,  for  given  values  of  the  random  numbers
 r     and  r   ,  GRAYL  samples  the  momentum  of  the
  1          2

 scattered  photon  and  the  scattering  angle  theta
 via  the  following  steps:



                   2             2
1.      sample  A(q   ) = r   A(q   )
                           1
                                 n

2.      find  the  (q         , q   ]  interval  which  gives
                     i-1         i

           2                   2             2
        A(q         )< =    A(q   )< =    A(q   )


           i-1                               i

3.      calculate  the  linear  extrapolation:


                           2        2                                   2        2
        q = q         +(A(q   )- A(q         ))((q   - q         )/ (A(q   )- A(q         )))
             i-1                                  i     i-1
                                    i-1                                 i        i-1

                                                                                                                             (4)

                                                   2       2
4.      calculate  mu    = costheta          = 1- q   / (2k   )

                                       2
5.      calculate  g   (q) = (1 + mu       )/ 2
                    i

6.      if  g   (q)>r     the  event  is  accepted,  otherwise
             i       2

        go  back  to  1.
