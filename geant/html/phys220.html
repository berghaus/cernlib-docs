       CALL  GCOMPI



GCOMPI  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for
Compton  scattering.  It  tabulates  the  mean  free
path,  lambda            = ((1)/ (Sigma         ))  (in  cm),  as  a
function  of  the  medium  and  of  the  energy  (see
JMATE  data  structure).  The  energy  binning  is  set
within  the  array  ELOW  (common  /GCMULO/)  in  the
routine  GPHYSI.  GCOMPI  is  called  at
initialisation  time  by  GPHYSI.

<PRE>


The  mean  free  path,  lambda           ,  for  a  photon  to
interact  via  Compton  scattering  is  given  by

lambda            = ((1)/ (Sigma         )) = ((A)/ (N      rho      ))((1)/ (sigma         (Z, E)))
                                                      Av


where:

      N                      Avogadro's  number
       Av



     Z, A                    atomic  and  mass  number  of  the  medium


      rho                    density  of  the  medium


sigma                        total  cross-section  per  atom  for  Compton  scattering


           E                 energy  of  the  photon.



For  the  total  cross-section  an  empirical
cross-section  formula  is  used  which  reproduces
the  cross-section  data  rather  well  down  to  10
keV:


                                                                                     2             2     3                         *

where


                                            m         =         electron  mass


                                            X         =         ((E)/ (m))



                                                                                    2
                                 P   (Z)              =         D    + E   Z + F   Z
                                  i                              i      i       i



The  values  of  the  parameters  are  put  in  the  DATA
statement  within  the  routine  GCOMPI.  The  fit  was
made  over  511  data  points  chosen  between:


              1< =    Z< =    100              ;                10 keV     < =    E< =    100 GeV



The  accuracy  of  the  fit  is  estimated  to  be:
