--  Case  2</H2>


<PRE>



       CALL  GDRVOL                         (NNAMS,CHNAMS,LNUMBS,NRS,THETA,PHI,PSI,U0,V0,SU,SV)



Draws  an  orthographic  parallel  projection  or  a
perspective  projection  (depending  on  the  option
chosen  via  GDOPT)  of  the  volume
CHNAMS(N),LNUMBS(N)  with  all  its  descendants,  at
the  position  U0,V0  (user  coordinates),  with  the
scale  factors  SU  and  SV.  The  object  is  seen  from
THETA  and  PHI  angles,  and  the  resulting  2D
projection  is  also  rotated  by  an  angle  PSI  on  the
screen  plane.  These  parameters,  as  well  as  zoom
parameters  set  by  GDZOOM,  define  the  current  view
parameters,  and  they  are  copied  in  /GCDRAW/.
Attributes  like  colour,  fill  area,  line  width,
line  style,  visibility,  etc.  can  be  set  by  the
GSATT  routine  for  CHNAMS(N)  and  or  its
descendants  [GEOM  500].  This  routine  differs  from
GDRAW  in  the  following  aspects:


   *   The  object  to  be  drawn  is  identified  by  a  full
       path.  This  gives  the  possibility  of  drawing  a
       particular  copy  or  division  of  a  volume,  or
       even  a  volume  that  has  more  than  one  mother  in
       the  geometry  tree.  CHNAMS(1),...,CHNAMS(N)
       contain  the  volume  names  and
       LNUMBS(1),...,LNUMBS(N),  the  volume  numbers
       defining  the  path  to  go  from  the  top  volume  to
       the  one  to  be  drawn.
   *   The  object  can  be  drawn  either  with  respect  to
       the  MAster  Reference  System  (NRS=0)  or  with
       respect  to  its  Daugther  Reference  System  (i.e.
       the  Local  R.S.);  in  the  first  case  it  is  drawn
       in  its  position  in  the  real  world,  while  in  the
       second  one  it  is  drawn  like  GDRAW  would  do.
   *   In  this  latter  case,  track  and  hit  points  will
       be  drawn  with  respect  to  the  DRS  of  the  volume
       last  drawn  by  this  routine,  and  not  with
       respect  to  the  MARS  as  is  done  normally  (to
       reset  to  the  normal  case  a  call  with  NRS=0  or
       NNAMS=0  is  required).



NNAMS               (INTEGER)  number  of  elements  levels  in  the
                    arrays  CHNAMS,  LNUMBS.  The  bottom  volume
                    of  this  path  is  also  the  one  that  is
                    actually  drawn;
CHNAMS              (CHARACTER*4)  array  of  volume  name
                    (dimensioned  at  least  to  NNAMS);
LNUMBS              array  of  volume  numbers  (dimensioned  at
                    least  to  NNAMS);
NRS                 reference  system  used:

                    NRS=0            to  have  the  volume(s)  drawn  with
                                     respect  to  the  MARS
                    NRS6=0           to  have  the  volume(s)  drawn  with
                                     respect  to  the  DRS

THETA               theta           angle  between  the  line  of  sight  and
                    the  Z  axis  of  MARS;
PHI                 phi       angle  between  the  projection  of  the
                    line  of  sight  on  plane  X  Y  and  the  X  axis  of
                    MARS
PSI                 psi       angle  by  which  the  projected  image
                    will  be  rotated  on  the  screen  plane
U0                  u  coordinate  on  the  screen  of  the  volume
                    origin
V0                  v  coordinate  on  the  screen  of  the  volume
                    origin
SU                  scale  factor  for  u  coordinates
SV                  scale  factor  for  v  coordinates
