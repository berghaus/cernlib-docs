<H2>Summary  of  the  physics  processes</H2>


<PRE>


The  computer  simulation  of  particles  traversing
an  experimental  setup  has  to  take  into  account
the  interactions  of  those  particles  with  the
material  of  the  detector.  GEANT  is  able  to
simulate  the  dominant  processes  which  can  occur
in  the  energy  range  from  10  keV  to  10  TeV  for
electromagnetic  interactions.  As  far  as  hadronic
interactions  are  concerned,  the  range  of  validity
is  the  one  of  the  hadronic  packages  used,  which
usually  does  not  extend  below  a  few  tens  of  MeV.
For  more  information  the  user  is  invited  to
consult  the  relevant  documentation  .


Simulating  a  given  process  means:



  --       Evaluating  the  probability  of  occurrence  of
       the  process,  by  sampling  the  total
       cross-section  of  the  process.

  --       Generating  the  final  state  after  interaction,
       by  sampling  the  differential  cross-section  of
       the  process.

  --       In  case  of  (quasi-)continuous  processes,  e.g.
       CSDA  (Continuous  Slowing  Down  Approximation),
       energy  losses  or  multiple  scattering,
       computing  the  mean  values  of  some
       characteristic  quantities.



In  Table  ??     below  we  summarise  all  the  processes
currently  implemented  in  GEANT,  with  a  reference
to  the  corresponding  sections.

<H3>  Simulated  Processes  </H3>

 </PRE>


 <H4>Hadronic  Interactions</H4>


 <PRE>


 To  simulate  the  interactions  of  hadrons  with  the
 nuclei  of  the  matter  traversed,  two  alternatives
 are  provided:


1.      The  generator  of  the  FLUKA    hadron  shower
        MonteCarlo  and  the  interface  routines  to
        GEANT.  See  [PHYS520]  for  more  information.
2.      The  generator  of  the  GHEISHA    hadron  shower
        MonteCarlo  and  the  interface  routines  to
        GEANT.  See  [PHYS510]  for  more  information.


 The  code  both  of  the  GHEISHA  and  of  the  FLUKA
 generators  is  contained  in  the  GEANT  library.
 Users  should  be  aware  that  the  routines  of  these
 packages  do  not  follow  the  GEANT  naming
 conventions  and  therefore  they  can  clash  with  the
 names  of  user  procedures.


 </PRE>


 <H4>Electromagnetic  Processes</H4>


 <PRE>


 By  means  of  systematic  fits  to  the  existing  data,
 the  cross-sections  of  the  electromagnetic
 processes  are  well  reproduced  (within  a  few
 percent)  from  10  keV  up  to  100  GeV,  both  for  light
 (low  Z)  and  for  heavy  materials.


 This  feature,  together  with  the  use  of  the
 interface  with  one  of  the  hadronic  shower
 generators  available,  makes  GEANT  useful  also  for
 shower  simulation  in  gases.


 </PRE>


 <H4>Muonic  interactions</H4>


 <PRE>


 Muonic  interactions  are  simulated  up  to  10  TeV,
 making  GEANT  useful  for  cosmic  rays  studies.


 </PRE>


 <H4>Ionisation  by  charged  particles</H4>


 <PRE>



 The  following  alternatives  are  provided  to
 simulate  this  process:


    *   Sampling  from  the  appropriate  distribution
        around  the  mean  value  of  the  energy  loss
        ([PHYS332]).
    *   Explicit  generation  of  delta         -rays  (see
        [PHYS330/331/430])  and  restricted
        fluctuations  below  the  energy  threshold  for
        the  production  of  delta         -rays.
    *   Sampling  the  contribution  of  single  collisions
        from  statistical  distributions.  This  can  be
        used  as  an  alternative  to  the  first  one  when
        simulating  energy  losses  in  very  thin  layers

                                -2
        (small  value  of  g  cm      )  (see  [PHYS334]).


 Full  Landau  fluctuations  and  generation  of
 delta         -rays  cannot  be  used  together  in  order  to
 avoid  double  counting  of  the  fluctuations.  An
 automatic  protection  has  been  introduced  in  GEANT
 to  this  effect.  See  [PHYS333/332]  and  [BASE040]
 for  further  information.


 </PRE>


 <H4>Multiple  Scattering</H4>


 <PRE>


 Two  methods  are  provided:


1.      Moliere  distribution  or  plural  scattering
        ([PHYS325],  [PHYS328]).
2.      Gaussian  approximation  ([PHYS320]).


 </PRE>


 <H4>The  JMATE  data  structure</H4>


 <PRE>


 In  order  to  save  time  during  the  transport  of  the
 particles,  relevant  energy-dependent  quantities
 are  tabulated  at  the  beginning  of  the  run,  for  all
 materials,  as  functions  of  the  kinetic  energy  of
 the  particle.  In  particular,  the  inverse  of  the
 total  cross-sections  of  all  processes  involving
 photons,  electrons  and  muons  and  the  dE/ dx  and
 range  tables  for  electrons,  muons  and  protons  are
 calculated.  The  actual  value  of,  say,  the
 interaction  length  for  a  given  process  (i.e.  the
 inverse  of  the  macroscopic  cross  section)  is  then
 obtained  via  a  linear  interpolation  in  the
 tables.  The  data  structure  which  contains  all
 this  information  in  memory  is  supported  by  the



link  JMATE  in  the  /GCLINK/  common  block.  See
[PHYS100]  and  [CONS199]  for  a  more  information  on
these  tables.


</PRE>


<H4>Probability  of  Interaction</H4>


<PRE>


The  total  cross-section  of  each  process  is  used
at  tracking  time  to  evaluate  the  probability  of
occurrence  of  the  process.  See  [PHYS010]  for  an
explanation  of  the  method  used.


Note:  The  section  PHYS  is  closely  related  to  the
section  CONS.  Users  wishing  to  have  a  complete
overview  of  the  physics  processes  included  in
GEANT  should  read  both  sections.


</PRE>


<H3>  Control  of  the  physical  processes</H3>


<PRE>


For  most  of  the  individual  processes  the  default
option  (indicated  below)  can  be  changed  via  data
records  [BASE040].  The  processes  are  controlled
via  a  control  variable  which  is  in  the  common
/GCKING/.  If  not  otherwise  noted,  the  meaning  of
the  control  variable  is  the  following:


=  0       The  process  is  completely  ignored.
=  1       The  process  is  considered  and  possible
           secondary  particles  generating  from  the
           interaction  are  put  into  the  /GCKING/  common.
           If  the  interacting  particle  disappears  in  the
           interaction,  then  it  is  stopped  with  ISTOP=1
           (common  /GCTRAK/)
=  2       The  process  is  considered.  If  secondary
           particles  result  from  the  interaction,  they
           are  not  generated  and  their  energy  is  simply
           added  in  the  variable  DESTEP  (common
           /GCTRAK/.  If  the  interacting  particle
           disappears  in  the  interaction,  the  variable
           ISTOP  is  set  to  2.


Below  are  listed  the  data  record  keywords,  the
flag  names  and  values,  and  the  resulting  action:
