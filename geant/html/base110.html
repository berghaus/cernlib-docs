routines</H2>

       CALL  GZEBRA                         (NZ)



Initialises  the  ZEBRA  memory  manager  to  use  the
common  /GCBANK/  to  store  the  GEANT  data
structures.


NZ                        (INTEGER)  size  of  the  /GCBANK/  common  as
                          it  is  dimensioned  in  the  main  program.


The  size  of  the  dynamic  memory  is  set  to  NZ-30.
The  common  /GCBANK/  must  be  dimensioned  in  the
main  program.  ZEBRA    must  be  initialised  only
once.  The  call  to  the  HBOOK  initialisation
routine  HLIMIT  tries  to  initialise  ZEBRA  as  well,
and  this  will  cause  a  program  abort.  To  avoid
this,  HLIMIT  must  be  called  after  GZEBRA  and  its
argument  must  be  a  negative  number  whose  absolute
value  is  the  size  of  the  /PAWC/  common  containing
the  histograms.  This  is  shown  in  the  example  of
main  program  given  in  [BASE100].



       CALL  GINIT



Presets  labelled  common  block  variables  to
default  values.  See  [BASE030]  for  more
information.



       CALL  GFFGO



Reads  a  set  of  data  records  via  the  FFREAD
package.  See  [BASE040]  for  more  information  on
the  possible  data  records.  GFFGO  must  be  called
after  GINIT.



       CALL  GZINIT



Initialises  the  ZEBRA  permanent  data  structures
in  division  2  of  the  GEANT  main  store  in  common
/GCBANK/.  Creates  the  user  long  term  division
(index  IXCONS)  (minimum  size  2000,  maximum  size
8*NZEBRA/10).  The  ZEBRA  division  IXDIV  is
reserved  for  the  event  data  structures  and  the
division  IXCONS  for  the  initialisation  data
structures.  Allocates  5200  words  of  working
space.  Initialises  the  link  areas  and  a  default
run  header  bank  JRUNG  [BASE299].  Defines  banks
format  for  I/O.  GZINIT  must  be  called  after
GFFGO.


A  layout  of  the  dynamic  store  is  shown  in  fig  ??    .

       CALL  GDINIT



This  routine  initialises  the  GEANT  drawing
package  [DRAW001]  and  it  has  to  be  called  before
any  other  graphic  routine.  GEANT  uses  the
CERN-developed  HIGZ    graphic  library,  and  this
has  to  be  initialised  before  the  call  to  GDINIT.
In  the  example  given  in  [BASE100]  the  routines
IGINIT  and  IGMETA  are  used.  Alternatively,  the
routine  HPLINT  from  HPLOT    can  be  used.  This
routine  calls  the  appropriate  procedures  from
HIGZ  to  initialise  the  underlaying  graphics
system.  At  the  moment  HIGZ  can  use  several
flavours  of  GKS    and  X11  and  it  is  available  on  all
machines  where  the  CERN  Program  Library  has  been
installed.



       CALL  GPHYSI



Completes  the  data  structure  JMATE,  (see
[PHYS100])  calculating  the  cross-section  and
stopping  power  tables.



       CALL  GBHSTA



Initialises  the  standard  histograms  requested  by
the  user  via  the  data  record  HSTA.  The  following
histogram  keywords  may  be  used  :


TIME                      time  per  event;
SIZE                      size  of  division  IXDIV  per  event;
MULT                      total  number  of  tracks  per  event;
NTRA                      number  of  long  life  tracks  per  event;
STAK                      maximum  stack  size  per  event.


GBHSTA  should  be  called  after  GFFGO.



       CALL  GGCLOS



This  routine  has  to  be  called  at  the  end  of  the
definition  of  the  geometry  by  the  user,  after
thal  all  volumes  have  been  defined  and  positioned
and  all  detectors  defined.  Failure  to  call  this
routine  will  prevent  the  GEANT  system  from
working  correctly.  Main  tasks  of  this  routine
are:


   *   close  the  geometry  package;
   *   complete  the  JVOLUM  data  structure;
   *   process  the  detector  definition  provided  by
       the  user;
   *   prepare  the  tables  for  the  tracking  speed
       optimisation  requested  by  the  user  via  the
       GSORD  routine  or  the  OPTI  data  record.
