</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>The  interactive  version  of
GEANT</H2>


<PRE>


The  interactive  version  is  an  essential  tool  for
users  who  are  in  charge  of  the  design  of  a
detector.  In  addition  to  all  the  batch  tools
which  are  also  available,  the  interactive  user
can  call  one  by  one  and  in  any  order  all  the  basic
functions  of  GEANT  to:


   *   design  or  modify  the  geometry  of  the  setup;
   *   exploit  the  drawing  package  in  a  more  efficient
       way;
   *   change  the  running  conditions  on  a  event  by
       event  basis.


The  system  is  based  on  the  KUIP    command
processor.  The  user  has  to  know  a  minimum  about
KUIP  and  should  read  at  least  the  first  chapter  of
the  manual.


A  set  of  encapsulated  Postscript  files  have  been
collected  in  a  new  section  XINT010.  They
illustrate  the  visualization  possibilities  of
the  interactive  version  of  GEANT.

<H2>Invoking  the  interactive  version</H2>


<PRE>


Instead  of  writing  a  MAIN  program  to  initialize
the  Geant  batch  version,  it  is  possible  to  use  the
MAIN  interactive  program  (GXINT321.F)  provided
in  /cern/pro/lib  exactly  as  the  library
LIBGEANT321.A.  The  user  has  simply  to  insert  in
his  link  file  the  file  GXINT321.F  as  the  main
program,  followed  by  the  user  object  code  and  by
the  library  LIBGEANT321.A.

Example:
PROGRAM  GXINT
*
*  GEANT  main  program.  To  link  with  the  MOTIF  user
interface
*  the  routine  GPAWPP(NWGEAN,NWPAW)  should  be



called,  whereas
*  the  routine  GPAW(NWGEAN,NWPAW)  gives  access  to
the  basic
*  graphics  version.
*
PARAMETER  (NWGEAN=3000000,NWPAW=1000000)
COMMON/GCBANK/GEANT(NWGEAN)
COMMON/PAWC/PAW(NWPAW)
*
CALL  GPAWPP(NWGEAN,NWPAW)
*
END

The  user  has  to  set  the  desired  value  of  NWGEAN
and  NWPAW  for  the  GEANT  and  PAW  Zebra  stores,  and
to  call  the  desired  initialization  routine:


   *   GPAW  to  initialize,  besides  GEANT,  also  HIGZ
       and  to  include  the  full  functionality  of  PAW;
   *   GPAWPP  to  initialize,  besides  GEANT  and  HIGZ,
       also  the  Motif  version  and  to  include  the  full
       functionality  of  Paw++;
   *   USER  initialization  routine,  to  do  anything
       else  (for  example  a  UGINIT-  like  routine  or  a
       gxint315.f--like  routine).


The  interactive  version,  after  the
initialization,  gives  the  control  to  the  user  at
the  prompt  GEANT  >  ;  then  it  is  possible  to  type
and  execute  commands  (corresponding  to  batch
routines)  to  edit  the  geometry,  the  materials  or
the  tracking  media  at  run  time.  It  is  also
possible  to  execute  commands  to  visualize  the
detectors,  to  set  the  kinematics  and  to  run
events.  Again  interactively,  one  can  spy  the
histograms,  change  the  kinematics,  and  run  more
events  (visualizing  the  tracks  and  the  hits,  for
example).  The  GXINT  chapter  contains  in  the
following  pages  a  full  description  of  the
available  GEANT  commands.  See  the  PAW,  KUIP,
DZDOC,  HIGZ  manuals  for  a  description  of  the
relative  commands  executable  from  GEANT.  All  the
commands  are  also  documented  by  an  on-line  help.
(Try  to  type  HELP  at  the  first  GEANT  >  prompt).  In
the  interactive  version,  a  COMIS  interface  is
also  available:  COMIS  is  a  FORTRAN  interpreter
which  allows:


   *   to  edit  at  run  time  important  routines  like
       UGEOM,  GUSTEP,  GUKINE,  etc.
   *   to  `execute'  them  from  the  interactive
       session,  without  having  to  recompile  and
       relink,  by  typing  commands  like  CALL  UGEOM.F.


Of  course  the  interpreter  is  slower  than  the
compiled  object  code,  then,  since  GEANT321,  it  is



also  possible  to  invoke  the  native  compiler  and
to  link  dinamically  to  the  executable  the
compiled  routine  (see  the  COMIS  manual  for
further  details).


The  following  write  ups  describe  individual
commands  which  can  be  typed  one  by  one  at  the
terminal,  or  grouped  into  macros  which  can  be
edited  and  saved  in  the  KUIP  environment.


The  commands  are  listed  in  subsection  1  -  13:



    1.             General  GEANT



    2.             Clipping  commands  GEANT/CVOL



    3.             Drawing  commands  GEANT/DRAWING



    4.             Graphics  control  commands  GEANT/DRAWING



    5.             Geometry  commands  GEANT/GEOMETRY



    6.             Volume  creation  commands  GEANT/CREATE



    7.             Control  commands  GEANT/CONTROL



    8.             ZEBRA/RZ  commands  GEANT/RZ



    9.             ZEBRA/FZ  commands  GEANT/FZ



    10.            Data  structure  commands  GEANT/DZ



    11.            Scanning  commands  GEANT/SCAN



    12.            Physics  parameter  commands  GEANT/PHYSICS



    13.            List  commands  GEANT/LISTS

<H2>The  Motif  Interface</H2>


<PRE>


The  interactive  version  3.21  contains  an  object
oriented  Motif-based  user  interface.  It  can  be
accessed  specifying  `m'  as  workstation  type.  The
full  functionality  of  the  X11  version  remains
available,  while  new  Motif-specific  features
have  been  added.



</PRE>


<H2>The  main  ideas</H2>


<PRE>


The  GEANT  data  structures  are  considered  as  KUIP
browsable  classes  and  their  contents  as  `objects'
on  which  one  can  perform  actions  (the  GEANT
commands).  According  to  the  Motif  conventions,  an
object  can  be  selected  clicking  the  left  button
of  the  mouse  (when  the  cursor  is  on  the  icon
representing  that  object).  Clicking  then  on  the
right  button  of  the  mouse,  a  menu  of  possible
commands  will  appear  (double  clicking  on  the  left
button  the  first  action  of  this  list  will  be
executed);  the  selected  command  will  perform  the
relative  actions  on  the  selected  object.  Such
actions  (like  drawing,  for  example)  can  be
executed  either  directly  or  via  the  use  of  an
automatically  opened  Motif  panel.  Objects  drawn
in  the  graphics  window  can  be  `picked'  as  well
(for  example,  volumes,  tracks,  hits);  clicking
the  right  button  when  the  cursor  is  on  the
selected  object,  a  menu  of  possible  actions  on
that  object  is  displayed.  Users  can  finally
define  Motif  panels  containing  buttons
corresponding  to  the  most  frequently  used
commands.  An  on-line  help  is  available  for  any
specific  subject.



</PRE>


<H2>The  Geant++  Executive  Window</H2>


<PRE>


It  replaces  the  normal  dialog  window;  it  contains
a  Transcript  Pad,  where  the  text  output  of  the
executed  commands  is  displayed,  and  an  Input  Pad,
where  the  user  can  still  type  the  desired
commands  in  the  old  style.

The  Geant++  Main  File  Browser

On  the  left  side  it  displays  a  list  of  the  GEANT
data  structures,  of  the  available  commands,  file,
macros  and  Zebra  divisions  used.  Selecting  one  of
them,  the  full  list  of  icons  representing  the
objects  of  that  class  is  shown  in  the  main  area  of
the  browser.  Proceeding  as  described  before,  it
is  possible  to  perform  actions  on  the  classes
(like  create  a  new  object)  or  on  the  objects
belonging  to  them.  It  is  possible  to  create  menus



of  commands  just  clicking  on  the  string
`commands'  at  the  top  line  of  the  browser.

The  Geant++  Graphics  Window

Any  object  to  be  drawn  in  the  graphics  window  can
be  stored  in  the  current  picture  file
(automatically  opened  after  each  NEXT  command)
via  a  call  to  IGPID  (see  Higz  manual).  It  can  be
afterwards  `picked'  as  described  before.  In  the
case  of  commands  executed  via  the  use  of  Motif
panels,  some  input  values  can  be  set  with  a  slider
ranging  in  the  specifed  range  for  the  relative
variable;  moving  the  slider  (after  having  clicked
on  the  right-hand  `activating  box')  the  relative
action  is  performed  in  the  graphics  window  when
releasing  the  button  of  the  mouse;  when  in  `drag
mode',  the  action  is  performed  while  moving  the
slider  (keeping  the  left  button  pressed):
especially  when  double  buffering  has  been
selected,  this  can  be  useful  for  real  time
manipulations.
