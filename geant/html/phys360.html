       CALL  GSYNC



GSYNC  is  called  for  electron  and  positrons  when
the  flag  ISYNC  is  set  >  0.  It  computes  the
magnetic  field  and  calls  GSYNGE  for  the
generation  of  the  synchrotron  radiation  photons.
It  reads  them  in  the  GEANT  stack.  GSYNC  is  called
from  GTELEC.



       CALL  GSYNGE                         (GAMMA,AMASS,FLDT,STEP,NTR,ETR,STR)



GSYNGE  generates  the  synchrotron  radiation  for  an

 -         +
e     or  e     with  the  Lorentz  factor  GAMMA  in  the
magnetic  field  FLDT  and  when  the  step  length  is
STEP.  The  number  of  the  secondary  photons  is  NTR,
their  energy  is  in  the  array  ETR  and  their
position  along  the  step  is  in  STR.  GSYNGE  is
called  by  GSYNC.

The  curvature  in  a  magnetic  field  B  which  has  a

Knowing  the  step  length,  the  energy  of  the
electron  and  the  curvature  of  the  particle  track
in  the  magnetic  field,  the  number  of  photons  in  a
step  delta         x  can  be  sampled  from  a  Poissonian
distribution  around  the  mean  value

Two  methods  have  been  implemented.  If  the  flag
ISYNC  is  set  to  1,  the  photons  are  emitted  at  the
end  of  the  step  along  the  current  direction.  If
ISYNC  is  set  to  3,  the  photons  are  emitted
randomly  along  the  tangent  the  real  trajectory  of
the  particle.  In  the  case  when  ISYNC  =  3,  the
magnetic  field  tracking  routines  are  called  for
each  photon,  and  therefore  this  option  is
considrably  slower  than  ISYNC  =  1.
