       CALL  GSVERT                         (VERT,NTBEAM,NTTARG,UBUF,NUBUF,NVTX*)



VERT                      (REAL)  array  of  3  containing  the
                          position  of  the  vertex  in  the  MRS;
NTBEAM                    (INTEGER)  beam  track  number  origin  of
                          the  vertex  (0  if  none  exists);
NTTARG                    (INTEGER)  target  track  number  origin  of
                          the  vertex  (0  if  none  exists);
UBUF                      (REAL)  user  array  of  NUBUF  user  words  to
                          be  stored  in  the  data  structure  together
                          with  the  vertex;
NWBUF                     (INTEGER)  number  of  user  words;
NVTX                      (INTEGER)  number  of  the  vertex  stored  (0
                          in  case  of  error).


This  routine  stores  the  parameters  of  a  vertex  to
which  tracks  should  be  attached  via  calls  to
GSKINE.  Vertices  are  stored  in  the  JVERTX  data
structure  (see  [KINE199])  and  they  are  preserved
for  the  whole  duration  of  the  event.


GEANT  tracks  one  vertex  at  a  time:  all  the
particles  of  one  vertex,  and  all  the  secondaries
generated  thereof  must  be  transported  before  the
particles  of  the  next  vertex  are  considered.


This  routine  should  be  called  only  from  GUKINE
when  the  initial  kinematics  of  the  event  is
defined.  During  tracking  it  is  possible  to  add
vertices  to  the  JVERTX  data  structure,  but  this
should  be  done  via  the  GSKING  routine  and  the
appropriate  variables  in  the  /GCKING/  common
block.  Please  see  [TRAK300]  for  more  information.



       CALL  GSVERU                         (NVTX,NUBUF,UBUF,IADR*)



NVTX                      (INTEGER)  vertex  number;



NUBUF                     (INTEGER)  number  of  user  words;
UBUF                      (REAL)  array  of  user  words;
IADR                      (INTEGER)  position  where  information  is
                          stored  in  the  user  bank  of  the  vertex.


This  routine  stores  the  first  NUBUF  words  of
array  BUF  in  the  user  bank  attached  to  vertex
NVTX,  starting  at  location  IADR+1.  On  exit  IADR
is  set  to  IADR+NUBUF,  allowing  subsequent
filling.  This  allows  effectively  to  add
information  to  an  existing  vertex,  whether  or  not
it  has  already  an  user  buffer.  This  is  the  only
way  to  add  user  information  to  a  vertex  which  has
been  created  at  tracking  time  by  the  routine
GSKING  via  an  appropriate  setting  of  parameters
in  the  common  /GCKING/.



       CALL  GFVERT                         (NVTX,VERT*,NTBEAM*,NTTARG*,TOFG*,UBUF*,NUBUF*)



Retrieves  vertex  parameters.  The  parameters  have
the  same  meaning  than  the  ones  of  GSVERT.


TOFG                      (REAL)  time  of  flight  when  the  vertex
                          was  created;



       CALL  GPVERT                         (IVTX)



Prints  vertex  parameters.


IVTX                      (INTEGER)  vertex  number  to  be  printed,
                          all  vertices  if  IVTX=0;



       CALL  GSKINE                         (PLAB,IPART,NV,UBUF,NUBUF,NT*)



PLAB                      (REAL)  array  of  3  containing  the
                          components  of  the  momentum  of  the

                                              -1
                          particle  in  GeV  c      ;
IPART                     (INTEGER)  particle  code  (see
                          [CONS300]);
NV                        (INTEGER)  number  of  the  vertex  origin  of
                          track;
UBUF                      (REAL)  array  of  NUBUF  user  words  to  be
                          stored  with  the  track;



NUBUF                     (INTEGER)  number  of  user  words;
NT                        (INTEGER)  number  of  the  stored  track  (0
                          in  case  of  error).


This  routine  stores  the  parameters  of  a  track  in
the  JKINE  data  structure  (see  [KINE199]).  This
data  structure  survives  for  the  whole  event,  and
it  is  wiped  out  by  GTRIGI  at  the  beginning  of  each
new  event.  There  are  two  reasons  to  store  tracks
in  the  JKINE  data  structure:


   *   at  the  beginning  of  an  event,  from  within
       GUKINE,  to  define  the  initial  kinematics  of  the
       event,  i.e.  the  particles  which  GEANT  will
       transport.  This  must  be  done  through  GSKINE
       after  that  the  vertices  from  which  the
       particles  originate  have  been  defined  through
       GSVERT;
   *   during  tracking,  to  preserve  the  kinematic
       information  of  a  particular  track  till  the  end
       of  the  current  event.  In  this  case  the  user
       should  not  call  GSKINE  directly,  but  rather  set
       the  appropriate  flags  in  the  /GCKING/  common
       block  and  call  GSKING.  This  is  explained  in
       detail  in  [TRAK300].



       CALL  GSKINU                         (NT,NUBUF,UBUF,IADR*)



NT                        (INTEGER)  track  number;
NUBUF                     (INTEGER)  number  of  user  words;
UBUF                      (REAL)  array  of  user  words;
IADR                      (INTEGER)  position  where  information  is
                          stored  in  the  user  bank  of  the  track.


This  routine  stores  the  first  NUBUF  words  of
array  BUF  in  the  user  bank  attached  to  track  NT,
starting  at  location  IADR+1.  On  exit  IADR  is  set
to  IADR+NUBUF,  allowing  subsequent  filling.  This
allows  effectively  to  add  information  to  an
existing  track,  whether  or  not  it  has  already  an
user  buffer.  This  is  the  only  way  to  add  user
information  to  a  track  which  has  been  created  at
tracking  time  by  the  routine  GSKING  via  an
appropriate  setting  of  parameters  in  the  common
/GCKING/.



       CALL  GFKINE                         (ITRA,VERT*,PVERT*,IPART*,NVERT*,UBUF*,NUBUF*)



Retrieves  long-life  track  parameters.  The



parameters  have  the  same  meaning  than  the  ones  of
GSKINE.



       CALL  GPKINE                         (ITRA)



Prints  initial  track  parameters.


ITRA                      (INTEGER)  track  to  be  printed,  all
                          tracks  if  IVTX=0;
