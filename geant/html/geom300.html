is</H2>


<PRE>



       CALL  GMEDIA                         (X,NUMED*)



X                         (REAL)  array  of  dimension  3  with  the
                          coordinates  in  the  MRS;
NUMED                     (INTEGER)  medium  number,  if  this  is  zero
                          the  point  is  outside  the  detector.


Searches  the  geometrical  tree  structure  to  find
in  which  volume  the  point  X  is.  The  tracking
medium  is  returned  in  NUMED,  and  the  common
/GCVOLU/  is  updated.


GMEDIA  uses  the  geometry  data  structure  to
conduct  its  search  starting  its  search  from  the
last  volume  where  a  point  was  found.  If  no
previous  search  has  been  conducted,  the  first
volume  is  used  as  a  starting  point.


If  the  point  is  not  inside  the  current  volume,
GMEDIA  looks  in  its  mother  and  so  on,  until  it
finds  a  volume  which  contains  the  point.  It  then
looks  at  the  contents  of  this  object  and  so  on
until  the  point  is  in  a  volume  but  in  none  of  its
contents  (if  any).


If  this  downward  search  terminates  in  a  'MANY'
object,  GMEDIA  looks  for  another  candidate.  See
[GEOM110]  for  a  description  of  the  `MANY'  volumes
tratment.


The  physical  geometrical  tree  from  the  first
volume  to  the  current  one  is  stored  in  the  common
block  GCVOLU  (see  [BASE030])  and  in  the  structure
JGPAR  (see  [GEOM199]).



       CALL  GTMEDI                         (X,NUMED*)



X                         (REAL)  array  of  dimension  3  with  the
                          coordinates  in  the  MRS;
NUMED                     (INTEGER)  medium  number,  if  this  is  zero
                          the  point  is  outside  the  detector.


This  routine  performs  the  same  function  than
GMEDIA,  but  it  uses  the  dynamical  information  of
the  particle  history  to  speed-up  the  search:


   *   when  INWVOL=2  (common  /GCTRAK/)  the  particle
       just  came  out  of  a  volume.  In  this  case,  if
       INFROM  (common  /GCVOLU/)  is  positive,  it  is
       interpreted  by  GTMEDI  as  the  number  IN  of  the
       content  just  left,  inside  the  mother  volume
       where  the  point  X  is  assumed  to  be.  This
       content  will  not  be  searched  again.
   *   the  daughter  of  the  current  volume  which  limits
       the  geometrical  step  of  the  particle  (i.e.
       where  the  particle  would  be  heading  moving
       along  a  straight  line)  is  searched  first.
       INGOTO  (common  /GCVOLU/)  is  set  by  GTNEXT,  to
       transmit  the  information  on  this  one  volume
       which  has  limited  the  geometrical  step  SNEXT  as
       follows:

                       th
       >0            IN        content;
       =0            current  volume;
       <0            -NLONLY,  with  NLONLY  defined  as  the
                     lowest  'ONLY'  level  up  in  the  tree  which
                     is  an  ancestor  of  the  'MANY'  volume  where
                     the  point  X  is.



       CALL  GINVOL                         (X,ISAME*)



X                         (REAL)  array  of  dimension  3  with  the
                          coordinates  in  the  MRS;
ISAME                     (INTEGER)  return  flag.


Checks  if  particle  at  point  X  has  left  current
volume.  If  so,  returns  ISAME  =  0  and  prepares
information  useful  to  identify  the  new  volume
entered,  otherwise,  returns  ISAME  =  1.
