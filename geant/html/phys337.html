       CALL  GBIRK                       (EDEP)



EDEP                      (REAL)  and  on  output  the  energy
                          equivalent  to  the  calorimeter  response
                          in  the  current  step.


Organic  scintillators  are  usually  calibrated
with  particles  whose  energy  is  near  the  minimum
ionisation  (gamma         beta        ss 4).  However,  the  energy
response  of  such  scintillators  for  large  local
energy  deposit  is  attenuated.  GBIRK  returns  the
energy  detected  by  the  scintillator  in  the
current  step.

The  phenomenological  description  of  the  response
attenuation  of  organic  scintillators    is  known  as
Birks'  law:

These  values  have  been  measured  for  various
scintillators.  If  the  charge  of  the  particle  is
greater  than  one,  a  better  description  can  be
obtained  by  correcting  C   :

The  values  of  the  parameters  of  Birks'  formula
(if  defined)  are  in  the  ZEBRA  bank  next  to  the
material  bank:

JTMN  =  LQ(JTM)                                           pointer  to  the  next  bank  to

                                                           where  the  specific  tracking
                                                           medium  parameters  are
                                                           stored;
MODEL  =  Q(JTMN+27)                                       flag  controlling  the
                                                           correction  (??    )  for
                                                           multiply  charged
                                                           particles:

                                                           6=1           correction  is  not

C1  =  Q(JTMN+28)                                          first  parameter  of  the
                                                           Birks'  formula;
C2  =  Q(JTMN+29)                                          second  parameter  of  the
                                                           Birks'  formula.


These  parameters  are  set  via  the  GSTPAR  routine,
with  names  BIRK1,  BIRK2  and  BIRK3,  respectively.
For  instance,  to  define  the  standard  Birks'
parameters  for  tracking  medium  ITM  with
correction  for  multiply  charged  particles,  one
would  have  to  insert  the  following  piece  of  code,
after  the  definition  of  tracking  media  but  before
the  call  to  GPHYSI
           CALL  GSTPAR(ITM,'BIRK1',1.)
           CALL  GSTPAR(ITM,'BIRK2',0.013)
           CALL  GSTPAR(ITM,'BIRK3',9.6E-6)
