<H2>Method</H2>


<PRE>


Due  to  the  statistical  nature  of  ionisation
energy  loss,  large  fluctuations  can  occur  in  the
amount  of  energy  deposited  by  a  particle
traversing  an  absorber  element.  As  recently
reviewed  ,  continuous  processes  such  as  multiple
scattering  and  energy  loss  play  a  relevant  role
in  the  longitudinal  and  lateral  development  of
electromagnetic  and  hadronic  showers,  and  in  the
case  of  sampling  calorimeters  the  measured
resolution  can  be  significantly  affected  by  such
fluctuations  in  their  active  layers.  The
description  of  ionisation  fluctuations  is
characterised  by  the  significance  parameter
kappa         ,  which  is  proportional  to  the  ratio  of  mean
energy  loss  to  the  maximum  allowed  energy
transfer  in  a  single  collision  with  an  atomic
electron
                                      kappa          = ((xi    )/ (E         ))
                                                                    max

E           is  the  maximum  transferable  energy  in  a
 max

single  collision  with  an  atomic  electron.

is  the  electron  mass.  xi     comes  from  the
Rutherford  scattering  cross  section  and  is
defined  as:


                   2   4                                                      2   2                 2                 2

     rho                     density



     delta         x         thickness  of  the  material



 kappa           measures  the  contribution  of  the  collisions
 with  energy  transfer  close  to  E         .  For  a  given
                                     max

 absorber,  kappa           tends  towards  large  values  if
 delta         x  is  large  and/or  if  beta         is  small.
 Likewise,  kappa           tends  towards  zero  if  delta         x  is
 small  and/or  if  beta         approaches  1.


 The  value  of  kappa           distinguishes  two  regimes
 which  occur  in  the  description  of  ionisation
 fluctuations  :


1.      A  large  number  of  collisions  involving  the  loss
        of  all  or  most  of  the  incident  particle  energy
        during  the  traversal  of  an  absorber.
        As  the  total  energy  transfer  is  composed  of  a
        multitude  of  small  energy  losses,  we  can  apply
        the  central  limit  theorem  and  describe  the
        fluctuations  by  a  Gaussian  distribution.  This
        case  is  applicable  to  non-relativistic
        particles  and  is  described  by  the  inequality
        kappa         >10  (i.e.  when  the  mean  energy  loss  in  the
        absorber  is  greater  than  the  maximum  energy
        transfer  in  a  single  collision).
2.      Particles  traversing  thin  counters  and
        incident  electrons  under  any  conditions.
        The  relevant  inequalities  and  distributions
        are  0. 01<kappa         <10,  Vavilov  distribution,  and
        kappa         <0. 01,  Landau  distribution.


 An  additional  regime  is  defined  by  the
 contribution  of  the  collisions  with  low  energy
 transfer  which  can  be  estimated  with  the  relation
 xi    / I   ,  where  I     is  the  mean  ionisation  potential
          0             0

 of  the  atom.  Landau  theory  assumes  that  the
 number  of  these  collisions  is  high,  and
 consequently,  it  has  a  restriction  xi    / I   >>    1.  In
                                                  0



GEANT,  the  limit  of  Landau  theory  has  been  set  at
xi    / I    = 50.  Below  this  limit  special  models  taking
         0

into  account  the  atomic  structure  of  the  material
are  used.  This  is  important  in  thin  layers  and
gaseous  materials.  Figure  ??     shows  the  behaviour
of  xi    / I     as  a  function  of  the  layer  thickness  for
             0

an  electron  of  100  keV  and  1  GeV  of  kinetic  energy
in  Argon,  Silicon  and  Uranium.

measure  the  validity  range  of  the  Landau  theory.
It  depends  on  the  type  and  energy  of  the  particle,
Z,  A  and  the  ionisation  potential  of  the  material
and  the  layer  thickness.



In  the  following  sections,  the  different  theories
and  models  for  the  energy  loss  fluctuation  are
described.  First,  the  Landau  theory  and  its
limitations  are  discussed,  and  then,  the  Vavilov
and  Gaussian  straggling  functions  and  the  methods
in  the  thin  layers  and  gaseous  materials  are
presented.

 </PRE>


 <H4>Restrictions</H4>


 <PRE>


 The  Landau  formalism  makes  two  restrictive
 assumptions  :


1.      The  typical  energy  loss  is  small  compared  to
        the  maximum  energy  loss  in  a  single  collision.
        This  restriction  is  removed  in  the  Vavilov
        theory  (see  section  ??    ).
2.      The  typical  energy  loss  in  the  absorber  should
        be  large  compared  to  the  binding  energy  of  the
        most  tightly  bound  electron.  For  gaseous
        detectors,  typical  energy  losses  are  a  few  keV
        which  is  comparable  to  the  binding  energies  of
        the  inner  electrons.  In  such  cases  a  more
        sophisticated  approach  which  accounts  for
        atomic  energy  levels  (see  for  instance  Talman  )
        is  necessary  to  accurately  simulate  data
        distributions.  In  GEANT,  a  parameterised  model
        by  L.  Urban  is  used  (see  section  ??    ).


 In  addition,  the  average  value  of  the  Landau
 distribution  is  infinite.  Summing  the  Landau
 fluctuation  obtained  to  the  average  energy  from
 the  dE/ dx  tables,  we  obtain  a  value  which  is
 larger  than  the  one  coming  from  the  table.  The
 probability  to  sample  a  large  value  is  small,  so
 it  takes  a  large  number  of  steps  (extractions)
 for  the  average  fluctuation  to  be  significantly
 larger  than  zero.  This  introduces  a  dependence  of
 the  energy  loss  on  the  step  size  which  can  affect
 calculations.


 A  solution  to  this  has  been  to  introduce  a  limit
 on  the  value  of  the  variable  sampled  by  the  Landau
 distribution  ,  in  order  to  keep  the  average
 fluctuation  to  0.  The  value  obtained  from  the
 GLANDO  routine  is:


                                                                                                                         2
 delta         dE/ dx = epsilon             - epsilon             = xi    (lambda           - gamma         '+beta           +ln   *
 * ((xi    )/ (E        @
                                                                                                                                   *
 *              max


 In  order  for  this  to  have  average  0,  we  must



impose  that:


                                                               2
              lambda            =- gamma         '- beta          - ln   ((xi    )/ (E         ))

                                                                                      max



This  is  realised  introducing  a  lambda                    (lambda           )
                                                     max

such  that  if  only  values  of  lambda           < =   lambda                      are
                                                                          max

accepted,  the  average  value  of  the  distribution
is  lambda           .


A  parametric  fit  to  the  universal  Landau
distribution  has  been  performed,  with  following
result:



lambda                     = 0. 60715+1. 1934lambda           +(0. 67794+0. 052382lambda           ) exp       (0. 94753+0. 74442la*
 *mbda           )
                 max



only  values  smaller  than  lambda                     are  accepted,
                                              max

otherwise  the  distribution  is  resampled.

<H3>Vavilov  theory</H3>


<PRE>


Vavilov    derived  a  more  accurate  straggling
distribution  by  introducing  the  kinematic  limit

The  Vavilov  parameters  are  simply  related  to  the
Landau  parameter  by
lambda               = lambda              / kappa         - ln    kappa         .  It  can  be  shown
                 L                      v

that  as  kappa         - >   0,  the  distribution  of  the
variable  lambda                approaches  that  of  Landau.  For
                           L

kappa         < =    0. 01  the  two  distributions  are  already
practically  identical.  Contrary  to  what  many
textbooks  report,  the  Vavilov  distribution  does
not  approximate  the  Landau  distribution  for  small
kappa         ,  but  rather  the  distribution  of  lambda
                                                                      L

defined  above  tends  to  the  distribution  of  the
true  lambda             from  the  Landau  density  function.
Thus  the  routine  GVAVIV  samples  the  variable
lambda                rather  than  lambda              .  For  kappa         > =   10  the
                 L                                   v

Vavilov  distribution  tends  to  a  Gaussian
distribution  (see  next  section).

Various  conflicting  forms  have  been  proposed  for

appear  to  have  little  theoretical  or  experimental
basis.  However,  as  noted  by  Schorr    it  has  been
demonstrated  by  Seltzer  and  Berger    that  for

The  method  for  computing  restricted  energy  losses
with  delta         -ray  production  above  given  threshold
energy  in  GEANT  is  a  Monte  Carlo  method  that  can
be  used  for  thin  layers.  It  is  fast  and  it  can  be
used  for  any  thickness  of  a  medium.  Approaching
the  limit  of  the  validity  of  Landau's  theory,  the
loss  distribution  approaches  smoothly  the  Landau
form  as  shown  in  figure  ??    .

The  parameter  C  can  be  defined  with  the  help  of
the  mean  energy  loss  dE/ dx  in  the  following  way:
The  numbers  of  collisions  (n   ,  i  =  1,2  for  the

In  a  step  Delta         x  the  mean  number  of  collisions  is

From  this,  using  the  equations  (??    ),  (??    ),  (??    )
and  (??    ),  one  can  define  the  parameter  C

The  following  values  have  been  chosen  in  GEANT
for  the  other  parameters:

    r = 0. 4



With  these  values  the  atomic  level  E     corresponds
                                          2

approximately  the  K-shell  energy  of  the  atoms  and
Zf     the  number  of  K-shell  electrons.  r  is  the  only
  2

variable  which  can  be  tuned  freely.  It  determines
the  relative  contribution  of  ionisation  and
excitation  to  the  energy  loss.


The  energy  loss  is  computed  with  the  assumption
that  the  step  length  (or  the  relative  energy
loss)  is  small,  and  ---  in  consequence  ---  the
cross-section  can  be  considered  constant  along
the  path  length.  The  energy  loss  due  to  the
excitation  is


                                        Delta         E    = n   E    + n   E                                               (9)

where  n     and  n     are  sampled  from  Poissonian
        1          2

the  ionisation  can  be  generated  from  the

If  the  number  of  ionisation  n     is  bigger  than  16,
                                  3

a  faster  sampling  method  can  be  used.  The
possible  energy  loss  interval  is  divided  in  two
parts:  one  in  which  the  number  of  collisions  is
large  and  the  sampling  can  be  done  from  a  Gaussian
distribution  and  the  other  in  which  the  energy
loss  is  sampled  for  each  collision.  Let  us  call
the  former  interval  [I, alpha         I]  the  interval  A,
and  the  latter  [alpha         I, E         ]  the  interval  B.

If  the  collision  number  is  high  ,  we  assume  that
the  number  of  the  type  A  collisions  can  be
calculated  from  a  Gaussian  distribution  with  the

                                A


It  is  further  assumed  that  the  energy  loss  in
these  collisions  has  a  Gaussian  distribution  with

The  energy  loss  of  these  collision  can  then  be
sampled  from  the  Gaussian  distribution.

The  total  energy  loss  is  the  sum  of  these  two
types  of  collisions:

This  conditions  gives  a  lower  limit  to  number  of
the  ionisations  n     for  which  the  fast  sampling

can  be  done:

As  in  the  conditions  (??    ),  (??    )  and  (??    )  the  value
of  c  is  as  minimum  4,  one  gets  n    > =    16.  In  order  to

speed  the  simulation,  the  maximum  value  is  used

The  number  of  collisions  with  energy  loss  in  the

If  the  step  length  is  very  small  (< =    5  mm  in  gases,
< =     2-3  mu    m  in  solids)  the  model  gives  0  energy
loss  for  some  events.  To  avoid  this,  the
probability  of  0  energy  loss  is  computed



                                          -(<n   >+<n   >+<n   >)

If  the  probability  is  bigger  than  0.01  a  special
sampling  is  done,  taking  into  account  the  fact
that  in  these  cases  the  projectile  interacts  only
with  the  outer  electrons  of  the  atom.  An  energy
level  E    = 10  eV  is  chosen  to  correspond  to  the
        0

outer  electrons.  The  mean  number  of  collisions
can  be  calculated  from

The  number  of  collisions  n  is  sampled  from
Poissonian  distribution.  In  the  case  of  the  thin

The  method  to  be  used  for  energy  loss  straggling
is  chosen  in  GFLUCT.  If  delta         -rays  are  produced
(DRAY  =  1)  above  the  cut  value  DCUTE  and  the
detailed  PAI  simulation  for  straggling  in  thin
layers  (see  PHYS334)  is  not  chosen  (STRA  =  0,
default),  GLANDZ  is  called  always  as  it  samples
from  the  restricted  distribution  (the  energy  loss
of  the  delta         -rays  which  are  explicitly  produced
should  not  be  taken  into  the  energy  loss
distribution).


If  delta         -rays  are  not  produced,  the  values  of
kappa           and  xi    / I  are  computed,  and  Urban,  Landau,
Vavilov  or  Gaussian  model  is  chosen  accordingly.
If  Urban  model  is  used,  GLANDZ  will  be  called  with
infinite  (BIG)  value  for  the  delta         -ray
production.


When  Landau  model  is  chosen,  it  is  possible  to  use
a  routine  from  the  CERN  Program  Library  to  sample
random  numbers  from  the  Landau  distribution  :
GENLAN  written  by  James  and  Hancock    and  copied
into  GEANT  source  file  as  GLANDG.  This  routine
has  been  modified  in  order  to  reproduce  the  tail
for  large  values  of  X.  The  original  routine  did
not  give  values  of  X  larger  than  200.
           CALL  GENLAN(X)


It  should  be  noted  that  over  the  years
considerable  confusion  has  arisen  over  the
precise  form  and  features  of  the  Landau
distribution.  As  an  example,  a  simpler  form  of
phi      (lambda           )  had  been  proposed  by  Moyal    and  used
on  occasions  which  has  little  in  common  with  the
function  defined  in  section  ??     .


For  the  Vavilov  distribution  we  have  used  the
function  GVAVIV  by  Rotondi  and  Montagna  .
