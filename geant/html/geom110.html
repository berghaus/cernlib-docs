       CALL  GSPOS                       (CHNAME,NR,CHMOTH,X,Y,Z,IROT,CHONLY)



Places  a  copy  of  a  volume  previously  defined  by  a
call  to  GSVOLU  inside  its  mother  volume  CHMOTH.


CHNAME                         (CHARACTER*4)  name  of  the  volume
                               being  positioned;
NR                             (INTEGER)  copy  number  of  the  volume
                               CHNAME  being  positioned;
CHMOTH                         (CHARACTER*4)  name  of  the  volume  in
                               which  copy  NR  of  CHNAME  is  positioned;
X                              (REAL)  x  position  of  the  volume  in  the
                               mother  reference  system;
Y                              (REAL)  y  position  of  the  volume  in  the
                               mother  reference  system;
Z                              (REAL)  z  position  of  the  volume  in  the
                               mother  reference  system;
IROT                           (INTEGER)  rotation  matrix  number
                               describing  the  orientation  of  the
                               volume  relative  to  the  coordinate
                               system  of  the  mother;
CHONLY                         (CHARACTER*4)  flag  to  indicate
                               whether  a  point  found  to  be  in  this
                               volume  may  also  be  in  other  volumes
                               which  are  not  direct  descendants  of  it
                               --  possible  values  are  ONLY  and  MANY.


The  following  points  are  important  for  a  correct
use  of  GSPOS:


   *   the  position  and  rotation  with  which  a  volume
       is  positioned  are  relative  to  the  mother
       reference  system,  that  is  to  the  reference
       system  of  the  volume  which  contains  the  copy
       being  positioned.  To  see  how  the  reference
       system  is  defined  for  the  GEANT  shapes,  see
       [GEOM050];
   *   GSPOS  can  be  called  several  times  with  the  same
       name,  to  place  multiple  copies  of  the  same



    volume  either  in  the  same  mother  volume  or  in
    different  ones.  The  copy  number  parameter  NR  is
    user  defined,  and  it  allows  the  different
    copies  of  the  same  volume  to  be  distinguished.
    The  user  is  free  to  assign  any  valid  integer  to
    this  parameter.  If  two  volumes  are  positioned
    with  the  same  copy  number,  it  will  be
    impossible  to  decide  in  which  one  a  particle  is
    during  tracking.  If  the  same  volume  is
    positioned  twice  inside  the  same  mother  with
    the  same  copy  number,  the  parameters  of  the
    second  call  to  GSPOS  will  override  the  first
    ones  for  that  copy;
*   all  the  copies  of  a  volume  are  identical:  in
    particular  they  contain  all  the  same  daughters
    recursively  --  conversely,  positioning  a
    volume  inside  a  mother  will  insert  it  in  all
    the  copies  of  that  mother;
*   the  volumes  mentioned  in  the  call  must  be
    already  defined  by  a  call  to  GSVOLU;
*   no  volume  can  be  positioned  in  a  divided
    mother;
*   in  case  of  positioning  without  rotation,  IROT
    should  be  set  to  0  --  note  that  this  is  faster
    than  defining  a  unit  matrix;
*   the  first  volume,  containing  all  the
    apparatus,  cannot  be  positioned;
*   if  the  CHONLY  flag  is  equal  to  ONLY,  the  volume
    being  positioned  should  not  overlap  with  any
    other  volume  except  his  mother  and  his
    daughters  and  should  not  extend  beyond  the
    limits  of  its  mother.  In  this  case  the  search
    routines  assume  that,  when  a  point  is  found  in
    this  volume,  the  only  further  searching
    required  is  in  its  contents.  Other  volumes  at
    the  same  or  higher  levels  or  in  separate
    branches  will  not  be  looked  at.  The  first
    volume  must  be  ONLY;
*   if  the  CHONLY  flag  is  set  to  MANY,  a  point  found
    in  this  volume  can  also  be  in  another  volume  at
    the  same  or  higher  level  or  in  a  different
    branch  of  the  tree.  To  decide  where  a  point  is
    the  following  algorithm  is  applied:
           1.      the  tree  is  scanned  upward  until  an  ONLY
                   mother  with  positioned  contents  (i.e.
                   non-divided)  is  found;
           2.      all  the  branches  of  the  tree  descending
                   from  this  volume  are  scanned  to  find
                   other  volumes  where  the  point  may  be;
           3.      a  winner  is  selected  among  the  candidates
                   according  to  the  following  rules:
                                 --     if  one  of  the  candidates  is  ONLY,
                                        the  point  is  declared  in  this
                                        volume.  If  more  than  one
                                        candidate  is  ONLY  there  is  an
                                        error  in  the  geometry  definition;



                                    --     amongst  several  MANY  candidates,
                                           the  one  at  the  deepest  level  is
                                           chosen;
                                    --     amongst  several  MANY  candidates
                                           at  the  same  level,  the  first  one
                                           found  is  chosen;
       Although  a  considerable  effort  has  been  put  in
       making  sure  that  the  MANY  option  works  properly
       and  caters  for  all  the  possible  cases,  still  it
       introduces  a  considerable  complication  in  the
       tracking  and  performance  can  be  rather  poor.
       Users  should  resort  to  this  only  when  it  is  not
       possible  to  describe  the  experimental  setup
       with  ONLY  volumes.


The  data  structure  is  so  designed  that,  in  any
case,  the  parameters  of  a  volume  and  the
information  about  the  number  and  position  of  its
daughters  are  stored  only  once.  This  allows  the
creation  of  very  complex  geometries  without
correspondingly  large  storage  requirements.
