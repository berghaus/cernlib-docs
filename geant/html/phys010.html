 The  simulation  of  the  processes  which  accompany
 the  propagation  of  a  particle  through  the
 material  of  the  detector  (e.g.  bremsstrahlung,
 delta         -rays  production,  Compton  scattering  and  so
 on)  is  performed  by  GEANT  in  the  following  steps:


1.      Fetch  a  new  particle  to  be  tracked  (often
        called  track  or  history)  from  the  stack
        supported  by  the  link  JSTAK  (see  [TRAK399]).
        This  is  done  once  at  the  beginning  of  each  new
        track.  The  number  of  interaction  lengths  that
        the  particle  is  going  to  travel,  before
        undergoing  each  one  of  the  possible  discrete
        processes,  is  sampled  at  this  point.  These
        operations  are  done  in  the  routine  GLTRAC.
2.      Evaluate  the  distance  to  the  interaction
        point.  This  is  done  by  the  individual  tracking
        routines  (GTGAMA,  GTNEUT,  GTHADR,  GTNINO,
        GTMUON,  GTHION  and  GTCKOV)  which  control  the
        tracking  of  particular  particles.  The  number
        of  interaction  lengths  remaining  to  travel
        before  each  of  the  possible  processes  (often
        called  tracking  mechanisms  or  simply
        mechanisms)  is  multiplied  by  the  inverse  of  the
        macroscopic  cross-section  for  that  process  in
        the  current  material  (i.e.  the  interaction
        length).  This  gives  the  distances  that  the
        particle  has  to  travel  before  each  of  the
        processes  occurs  in  the  current  medium.  The
        minimum  among  these  numbers  is  the  step  over
        which  the  particle  will  be  transported.  In
        addition  to  the  physics  mechanisms,  four
        pseudo-interactions  are  taken  into  account  in
        the  calculation  of  the  step:
            (a)        boundary  crossing.  The  crossing  of  a
                       volume  boundary  is  treated  like  a
                       discrete  process.  A  particle  never



                       crosses  a  boundary  during  a  step  but
                       rather  stops  there  (NEXT  mechanism);
            (b)        maximum  step  limit.  For  each  tracking
                       medium  a  value  for  the  maximum  step  can  be
                       specified  by  the  user.  Process  SMAX;
            (c)        maximum  fraction  of  continuum  energy
                       loss,  maximum  angular  deviation  in
                       magnetic  field  or  maximum  step  for  which
                       the  Moliere  formula,  to  simulate  multiple
                       scattering  is  valid.  These  are  continuous
                       processes,  which  introduce  a  limitation
                       on  the  tracking  step  expressed  by  a
                       single  variable  (see  section  [PHYS325]  on
                       GMULOF).
            (d)        energy  and  time  cut.  Charged  particles  in
                       matter  are  stopped  when  their  energy
                       falls  below  their  energy  threshold  or
                       when  their  time  of  flight  exceeds  the
                       time  cut;
        More  information  is  given  in  the  individual
        sections  explaining  the  implementation  of  the
        physical  processes.
3.      Transport  the  particle  either  along  a  straight
        line  (if  no  magnetic  field  or  for  a  neutral
        particle)  or  along  a  helicoidal  path  (for
        charged  particles  in  magnetic  field).
4.      Update  the  energy  of  the  particle  if  continuous
        energy  loss  was  in  effect  (charged  particles  in
        matter).
5.      If  a  physical  discrete  process  has  been
        selected,  generate  the  final  state  of  the
        interaction.
6.      If  the  incident  particle  survives  the
        interaction  (Compton,  delta         -rays  production,
        bremsstrahlung,  direct  pair  production  by  mu
        and  mu    -nucleus  interaction,  hadronic  elastic
        scattering),  sample  again  the  number  of
        interaction  lengths  to  travel  before  the  next
        event  of  the  same  kind.  This  is  generally  done
        by  specialised  routines:  GMUNU,  GCOMP,  GBREM,
        etc.
7.      Update  the  number  of  interaction  lengths  for
        all  the  processes  and  go  back  to  (2)  till  the
        particle  either  leaves  the  detector  or  falls
        below  its  energy  threshold  or  beyond  its  time
        cut  or  disappears  in  an  interaction.

For  electromagnetic  processes  which  depend

This  mean  free  path  is  tabulated  at
initialisation  time  as  a  function  of  the  kinetic

Cross  sections  are  tabulated  in  the  energy  range

cannot  be  bigger  than  199.  The  array  ELOW  is  in

<H3>Determination  of  the  interaction  point</H3>


<PRE>


The  mean  free  path  of  a  particle  for  a  given
process,  lambda           ,  depends  on  the  medium  and  cannot
be  used  directly  to  sample  the  probability  of  an
interaction  in  a  heterogeneous  detector.  The
number  of  mean  free  paths  which  a  particle
travels  is:

                           N                  = R  ((dx)/ (lambda           (x)))
                            lambda


and  it  is  independent  of  the  material  traversed.
If  N     is  a  random  variable  denoting  the  number  of
     R



mean  free  paths  from  a  given  point  until  the  point
of  interaction,  it  can  be  shown  that  N     has  the
                                             R

distribution  function


                                                               -N
                              P(N   <N                 ) = 1- e  lambda
                                 R    lambda


The  total  number  of  mean  free  paths  the  particle
travels  before  the  interaction  point,  N                 ,  is
                                            lambda

sampled  at  the  beginning  of  the  trajectory  as:


                                         N                  =- log       (eta      )
                                          lambda


where  eta       is  a  random  number  uniformly
distributed  in  the  range  (0, 1).  N                   is
                                       lambda

updated  after  each  step  Delta         x  according  the
formula:


          N'                  = N                 - ((Delta         x)/ (lambda           (x)))
            lambda               lambda


until  the  step  originating  from
s(x) = N                 lambda           (x)  is  the  shortest  and  this
        lambda

triggers  the  specific  process.

The  first  9  processes  (from  PAIR  production  up  to
MUon  NUclear  interaction)  and  the  RAYLeigh
scattering  and  Light  ABSorbtion  have  the  same
scheme.  Let's  take  as  an  example  the  first  one
(for  a  complete  description  of  the  common  see
[BASE030]):


IPAIR            flag  for  secondaries:

                 2=         no  generation  of  secondaries.

                 point  where  the  mechanism  was  active,  i.e.
                 IPAIR6= 0.
SLPAIR           track  length  at  the  time  when  the
                 interaction  last  happened  for  the  current
                 particle.  Only  SLPAIR  (direct  pair

                 mu    ),  SLHADR  (hadronic  interactions),
                 SLMUNU  (muon-nucleus  interactions)  and
                 SLRAYL  (Rayleigh  effect)  are  used.  The
                 variables  SOLOSS,  STLOSS,  SOMULS,  STMULS
                 are  obsolete.  They  have  been  kept  for
                 backward  compatibility,  but  their  value  is
                 undefined  and  should  not  be  used.

                 last  point  where  the  mechanism  was  active,
                 i.e.  IPAIR6= 0.
STEPPA           lambda           (x)  = value  of  the  interaction  length
                 at  the  last  point  where  the  mechanism  was
                 active,  i.e.  IPAIR6= 0;


The  evaluation  and  update  of  the  quantities  like
STEPPA,  SPAIR  and  ZINTPA  are  turned  off  in  the
media  where  the  mechanism  is  not  active
(IPAIR          6= 0).  Turning  off  a  mechanism  in  one
tracking  medium  may  give  incorrect  physics
results  because  not  only  will  the  mechanism  not
be  active,  but  the  interaction  probabilities  will
not  be  updated,  as  if  that  medium  had  not  been
traversed  at  all.  This  feature  of  the  tracking
routines  is  used  mainly  in  the  vacuum,  (defined
as  a  medium  with  atomic  number  Z  <1),  where  all  the
mechanisms  but  DECAy  (and  SYNChrotron  radiation,
if  activated)  are  inactive.


The  DECAy  in  flight  is  simpler  since  the  mean  life
time  of  the  particle,  tau     ,  is  not  material
dependent  and  can  be  sampled  directly.



SLIFE            not  used.
SUMLIF           proper  time  left  before  the  decay.  At  the
                 beginning  of  the  track
                 SUMLIF            = - ctau      log       (eta      ).
SDCAY            distance  left  to  decay  point  evaluated  at
                 the  last  point  where  the  mechanism  was
                 active,  i.e.  IDECA          6= 0.

<H2>Cross-section,  energy  loss  and  range
tables</H2>


<PRE>


Cross-sections,  energy  loss  dE/ dx  and  range
R(E         )  are  tabulated  for  all  materials  which
   kin

enter  in  the  definition  of  a  tracking  medium  by
the  routine  GPHYSI.  The  values  of  the  energy  for
which  the  tabulated  quantities  are  calculated  are
stored  in  the  common  /GCMULO/  (see  [BASE030]).  To
evaluate  one  of  the  tabulated  quantities  for  a
particle  of  kinetic  energy  E   ,  a  linear
                                0

interpolation  is  used.  Let  i  be  such  that:


                                                  E   <E   < =    E

The  integer  variable  IEKBIN  in  common  /GCTRACK/
is  equal  to  i  during  tracking  and  its  value  is
recomputed  by  the  routine  GEKBIN  when  the  energy
of  the  particle  changes.  If  the  quantity  Y  has
been  tabulated  so  that  Y    = Y(E   )  then  the  value
                            i        i

Y    = Y(E   )  is  calculated  as:
 0        0



Y    = Y   +((E   - E   )/ (E         - E   ))(Y         - Y   ) = Y   (1- ((E   - E   )/ (E         - E   )))+Y         ((E   - E *

Inside  the  code  the  following  quantities  are
used:



GEKRAT            = ((E   - E   )/ (E         - E   ))                                                             GEKRT1          *

<H2>The  energy  loss  tables</H2>


<PRE>


Energy  loss  and  multiple  scattering  are
continuous  processes  that  are  applied  at  every
step  for  charged  particles  in  matter  (Z  > =   1).


As  explained  in  [PHYS330]  and  [PHYS430],  energy
loss  tables  are  calculated  at  initialisation  time
(GPHYSI)  for  all  the  materials  which  enter  in  the
definition  of  a  tracking  medium  (see  [CONS200]).
These  tables  contain  NEK1  values  of  dE/ dx
calculated  for  the  corresponding  values  of  energy
in  ELOW.


In  case  of  mixtures/compounds,  the  rule    is  to

                                              -1        2
combine  the  energy  loss  tables  in  GeV  g        cm
according  to  the  proportion  by  weight  of  the
elements,  that  is:



((dE)/ (dx)) = rho      sum        ((p   )/ (rho         ))(((dE)/ (dx)))
                            i         i               i                  i



</PRE>


<H2>Limitations  on  the  step  size</H2>


<PRE>


The  routine  GMULOF  called  by  GPHYSI  creates  and
fills  a  table  of  NEK1  values  corresponding  to  the
ELOW  values  containing  the  smaller  of  the  upper
limits  for  the  step  imposed  by  the  three
continuous  processes:  energy  loss,  multiple
scattering  and  bending  of  the  track  induced  by
the  magnetic  field.


Continuous  energy  loss  can  introduce  an  upper
limit  on  the  step  via  the  variable  DEEMAX,  an
argument  to  the  GSTMED  routine.  During  tracking
the  value  of  DEEMAX  for  the  current  medium  is
stored  in  the  common  /GCMATE/.  DEEMAX  is  the
maximum  fraction  of  kinetic  energy  which  a
particle  can  lose  in  a  step  due  to  continuous
ionisation  (0<DEEMAX           <1).  The  limitation  on  the
step  size  coming  from  DEEMAX  is:


                                step< =    ((DEEMAX           )/ (dE/ dx))



Multiple  scattering  as  well  can  limit  the  step



size,  see  [PHYS325].  The  limitation  is  given  as:

                                  step< =    min      (T               , 10 X   )
                                                        Bethe                0


where  X     is  the  radiation  length  and  T                is  the
        0                                      Bethe

maximum  step  for  which  the  Moliere  approximation
is  valid  (see  [PHYS325]).


Another  upper  limit  on  the  step  size  comes  from
the  magnetic  field.  The  bending  of  the  particle
trajectory  in  the  magnetic  field  may  be  limited
by  the  TMAXFD  argument  to  the  GSTMED  routine.
During  tracking  the  value  of  TMAXFD  for  the
current  medium  is  stored  in  the  common  /GCMATE/.


A  lower  limitation  on  the  tracking  step  is  not
generally  imposed.  There  is,  however,  a
protection  against  the  step  being  reduced  to  a
very  small  value  by  continuous  processes.  In
particular  multiple  scattering  at  low  energies
(<1  MeV)  can  impose  a  very  small  tracking  step
with  serious  consequences  on  the  tracking  time.
To  avoid  this,  a  lower  limit  on  the  step  imposed
by  continuous  processes  is  introduced:  STMIN.  The
meaning  of  STMIN  is  the  following:  below  1  MeV  the
stopping  range  is  usually  small.  If  the  stopping
range  becomes  smaller  than  STMIN,  the  constraint
imposed  by  the  multiple  scattering  is  ignored  and
the  minimum  is  taken  between  the  reduced  stopping
range  (the  distance  the  particle  has  to  travel  to
reach  its  threshold  energy)  and  STMIN  itself.  In
this  sense  STMIN  is  no  more  than  a  tracking
accelerator  for  stopping  particles.


Another  limitation  on  the  step  size  which  is
imposed  by  the  tracking  routines  during  transport
is  the  STEMAX  parameter  of  GSTMED  which  sets  an
absolute  upper  limit  to  the  size  of  a  step  for
each  tracking  medium.


</PRE>


<H2>Automatic  calculation  of  parameters</H2>


<PRE>


The  definition  of  a  tracking  medium  requires  the
specification  by  the  user  of  a  set  of  parameters
(see  [CONS200])  which  can  critically  affect  the
tracking  and  hence  the  physics  results  of  the
GEANT  MonteCarlo.  To  help  the  user  to  find  the
optimal  set  of  parameters,  by  default  GEANT
overrides  the  values  of  STMIN,  DEEMAX,  STEMAX  and
TMAXFD.  This  behaviour  is  controlled  by  the  AUTO
data  record  and  interactive  command.  By  default



AUTO=1  and  automatic  evaluation  of  the  parameters
is  enforced  (see  below  for  the  partly  anomalous
behaviour  of  TMAXFD).  When  AUTO= 0  then  only  those
parameters  which  are  <0  are  recalculated  by
GEANT,  while  for  the  others  the  user  input  is
accepted  with  minimal  checking.


When  the  automatic  calculation  of  parameters  is
active,  the  following  applies:


DEEMAX              The  formula  used  by  GEANT  is  the
                    following:

                                                       p  ======

                                             ((0. 2)/ (   X     ))                                               if           ISVOL*

                    ISVOL         >0  defines  a  sensitive  detector,
                    while  ISVOL         < =   0  is  a  non-sensitive
                    detector  (see  [HITS]).
STMIN               The  default  value  corresponds  to  a
                    stopping  range  of  200  keV  above  CUTELE.

                                                              o
TMAXFD              The  default  value  corresponds  to  20       if

                                                                         o
                    the  input  value  to  GSTMED  is  < =   0  or  >20     ,
                    otherwise  the  input  value  is  taken.

                                               10
STEMAX              The  default  value  is  10        (BIG  variable  in
                    common  /GCONST/).


These  values  have  been  tuned  empirically  on  a
variety  of  setups  and  users  are  invited  to  start
with  automatic  computation.  The  values  of  the
parameters  can  be  checked  with  a  call  to
GPRINT('TMED',0)  after  GPHYSI  has  been  called.
Use  of  AUTO  mode  is  strongly  recommended  because
it  makes  GEANT  a  predictive  tool.  In  this  way  all
parameters  are  automatically  computed  by  the
system  as  opposed  to  tuning  data  and  MonteCarlo
via  the  tracking  parameters.

<H2>Energy  loss</H2>


<PRE>



</PRE>


<H3>Energy  loss  tables</H3>


<PRE>


In  previous  versions  of  GEANT  (up  to  version
3.13)  the  energy  lost  by  a  charged  particle
travelling  through  matter  was  calculated  by  the
formula:
                                Delta         E = ((dE)/ (dx)) x step

The  quantity  dE/ dx  was  calculated  and  tabulated


for  e   ,  mu         and  protons  and  the  value  for  a
particle  of  a  given  energy  E     was  calculated
                                 0

interpolating  linearly  the  tables:


. ((dE)/ (dx))_                                          =         . ((dE)/ (dx))_            +((E   - E   )/ (E         - E   ))(.*
 * ((dE)/ (dx))_       @
               E=E                                                                E=E             0     i       i+1         i      *
 *              E=E    @
                  0                                                                  i                                             *
 *                 i+1 @



                                                         =         GEKRT1          x. ((dE)/ (dx))_            +GEKRAT           x.*
 * ((dE)/ (dx))_       @
                                                                                                   E=E                             *
 *              E=E    @
                                                                                                      i                            *
 *                 i+1


These  formula  work  of  course  on  the  assumption
that  the  error  is  negligible.  But  the  error  on  the

                              2
linear  approximation  is  O(@   E/ @x @E)  which  is  far
from  negligible  at  low  energy.  In  this  way  the
energy  loss  at  low  energies  was  constantly
underestimated  and  the  particles  could  travel  too
far  before  stopping.


</PRE>


<H3>Stopping  range  tables</H3>


<PRE>


To  correct  for  this  problem,  a  different  approach
was  introduced  in  GEANT  version  3.14.  The
stopping  range  of  a  particle  is  defined  as  the
distance  that  the  particle  will  travel  before
stopping.  By  definition  the  stopping  range  for  a
particle  of  energy  E     is  given  by:
                       0



                   0                                                 E
            R = R        ((dx)/ (dE)) dE                        = R   0    - ((dx)/ (dE)) dE


                   E
                    0                                                0



 Note  that  in  the  tables  the  positive  quantity
 - dE/ dx  is  stored.  The  method  used  was  to  build  a
 table  of  stopping  ranges  based  on  ELOW  by
 integrating  the  inverse  of  the  dE/ dx  tables  in
 GRANGI.  At  tracking  time  the  algorithm  was  the
 following:


1.      Evaluate  the  stopping  range  for  the  threshold
        energy  (STOPC).  This  was  done  only  once  at  the
        beginning  of  each  new  track.
2.      From  the  energy  of  the  particle  derive  the
        stopping  range  by  a  linear  interpolation  of  the
        range  table:


                                  R    = GEKRT1            x R    + GEKRAT           x R
                                   0                          i                         i+1


        where  E   <E   < =    E         .
                i    0          i+1

3.      Evaluate  the  stopping  range  for  the  particle
        after  the  step:  R'    = R   - step.  If  this  is  less
                             0      0

        than  the  stopping  range  of  a  particle  with
        threshold  energy,  the  particle  is  terminated
        as  a  stopping  particle  below  the  energy  cut.
        Otherwise  the  following  quantities  are
        evaluated:


        R   <R'   < =    R                                       GEK       = ((R'   - R   )/ (R         - R   ))                   *
 *                      @
         j     0          j+1                                                    0     j       j+1         j


        and  the  final  energy  is  computed  as:


                          E'    = GEK1        x ELOW(         j)   + GEK      x ELOW(         j+1)
                            0


4.      the  energy  loss  is  computed  as:


                                                   Delta         E = E   - E'
                                                                      0      0


        This  value  is  then  corrected  to  take  into
        account  the  energy  loss  fluctuations  (see
        [PHYS332]).


 This  method  has  two  main  disadvantages.  The  first
 is  due  to  the  finite  precision  of  computers.  As
 the  energy  loss  in  a  step  is  calculated  as  the
 difference  of  two  numbers,  it  is  subject  to  large
 relative  errors.  The  effect  can  be  particularly
 serious  in  the  case  of  light  materials,  particles
 near  the  minimum  ionisation  point  or  with  very
 short  steps,  where  Delta         E = DESTEP             can  even  result
 in  a  negative  quantity.  As  the  relative  precision

                                        -6
 of  a  32-bit  computer  is  around  10      ,  the  error  on



the  energy  loss  of  a  100  GeV  track  can  be  as  large
as  100  keV.


The  second  problem  connected  with  this  method  can
be  easily  shown  if  we  compute  dE/ dx  as:



    ((dE)/ (dx))                          =         ((d)/ (dx))(E   - E'   )  =  ((d)/ (dx))(E   - GEK1        x ELOW(         j)  *
 *- GEK      x ELOW(   @
                                                                 0      0                     0



                                          =         ((d)/ (dx))(E   - E   - ((R'   - R   )/ (R         - R   ))(E         - E   )) *
 * = - ((d)/ (dx))((Del@
                                                                 0     j        0     j       j+1         j      j+1         j     *
 *                     @



                                          =         - ((Delta         E   )/ (Delta         R   ))((dR'   )/ (dx))  =  ((Delta     *
 *    E   )/ (Delta    @
                                                                       j                     j         0                           *
 *     j               @


As  we  can  see,  the  reconstructed  dE/ dx  curve  due
to  continuous  energy  loss  is  a  step  function  and
constant  in  each  energy  bin.  Thus,  although  the
results  obtained  with  GEANT  3.14  were  very
satisfactory,  this  was  felt  to  be  an  undesirable
feature.

<H3>Energy  loss  in  GEANT</H3>


<PRE>


The  two  problems  mentioned  above  have  been  solved
in  GEANT  3.15.  As  far  as  the  precision  is
concerned,  the  solution  was  to  revert  to  the
algorithm  of  GEANT  3.13  every  time  the  relative
energy  loss  in  the  step  (DESTEP/GEKIN)  is  smaller
than  five  times  the  machine  precision.  This  has
given  good  results  without  loosing  the
substantial  improvements  obtained  in  GEANT  3.14
with  the  introduction  of  the  stopping  range
algorithm.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  above
condition  happens  only  the  in  the  case  of  very
small  steps  or  when  the  dE/ dx  curve  is  very  flat,
and  in  both  cases  the  algorithm  based  on  the  dE/ dx
tables  is  a  good  approximation.


The  second  problem  has  been  solved  by  changing
the  interpolation  algorithm,  going  from  a  linear
to  a  quadratic  interpolation.  Instead  of  assuming
a  linear  relation  between  energy  and  stopping
range  in  every  energy  bin,  we  assume  a  quadratic
relation  of  the  sort:


                                                          2
                                         E  =  f(R)  =  aR    + bR + c

The  only  problem  now  is  the  determination  of  the
coefficients  a,  b  and  c.  To  do  this  we  recall  that



 the  general  formula  of  the  parabola  which  passes
 through  the  points  (x   , y   ), (x   , y   ), (x   , y   )  is

 This  allows  us  to  calculate  and  tabulate  the
 coefficients  a,  b  and  c  just  by  replacing  y     by
                                                    i

 ELOW(I)  and  x     by  the  corresponding  stopping
                i

 range  ELOW(i).  In  the  routine  GRANGI  a  table  of
 length  3 x (NEKBIN           - 1)  is  created:

 where  E    = ELOW(I)              and  R    = R(ELOW(I))                  .  The
         I                                I

 calculation  of  the  energy  loss  is  now  done  in  the
 following  steps:


1.      Evaluate  the  stopping  range  for  the  threshold
        energy  (STOPC),  only  once  at  the  beginning  of
        each  new  particle  tracking.
2.      From  the  energy  of  the  particle  derive  the
        stopping  range  by  a  quadratic  interpolation  of
        the  range  table:


                                                 p  ===========================================================

                                                          2
          R    =- B     + ((A     )/ (_A     _))    B        - (C     - ((E   )/ (A     )))
           0       I         I          I            I           I         0       I



        The  value  of  I  is  chosen  according  to  the
        following.  Let  i  be  such  that
        ELOW(         i)  <E   < =    ELOW(         i + 1    )  :
                            0



                   max     (i- 1, 1)                                 if           ((E   - ELOW(         i)  )/ (ELOW(         i + 1*

        I   = -                                                                                                                    *
 *                      @

                   min     (i, NEKBIN           - 1)                 if           ((E   - ELOW(         i)  )/ (ELOW(         i + 1*
 *     )  - ELOW(       @
                                                                                     0



        The  value  of  0. 7  is  an  empirical  number  which
        minimises  the  discontinuities  of  the
        reconstructed  dE/ dx  curve.
3.      Evaluate  the  stopping  range  for  the  particle
        after  the  step:  R'    = R   - step.  If  this  is  less
                             0      0

        than  the  stopping  range  of  a  particle  of
        threshold  energy,  the  particle  is  terminated
        as  a  stopping  particle  below  the  energy  cut.
        Otherwise,  the  final  energy  is  computed  as:


                                    E'    = A     (C      + R'   (2B      + R'   ))
                                      0      I      I         0     I         0


4.      the  energy  loss  is  computed  as:


                                                   Delta         E = E   - E'
                                                                      0      0


        This  value  is  then  corrected  to  take  into
        account  the  energy  loss  fluctuations  (see
        [PHYS332]).


 This  method  results  in  a  dE/ dx  curve  which  is  a
 set  of  connected  straight  lines  and  not  a  step
 function.
