<H2>The  drawing  package  </H2>


<PRE>


The  drawing  package  has  been  designed  mainly  to
visualise:


   *   detector  components;
   *   the  logical  tree  of  detector  components;
   *   the  geometrical  dimensions;
   *   particle  trajectories
   *   the  hits  recorded  in  the  sensitive  elements  of
       the  detector.

<H2>Graphics  in  GEANT</H2>


<PRE>


The  set  of  routines  in  the  drawing  package  allows
the  visualisation  of  the  volumes  of  the  detector.
These  routines  can  be  called  from  the  user
program  or  interactively  via  the  command
interface.  The  output  can  be  directed  onto  the
screen  or  to  a  file.  The  graphics  of  GEANT  is
based  on  the  HIGZ    package.  HIGZ  is  a  high-level
interface  between  the  user  program  (in  this  case
GEANT),  ZEBRA  and  a  basic  graphics  library.  At
the  moment  of  writing,  HIGZ  can  use  various
flavours  of  the  GKS    graphics  system  or  the  X11
system.  A  version  based  on  the  PHIGS  system  is  now
being  developed  at  CERN.

<H2>Graphics  functionality  of  GEANT</H2>


<PRE>


The  graphics  capabilities  of  GEANT  have  been



greatly  enhanced  in  the  last  few  revisions  of  the
program.  It  is  now  possible  to  display  volumes
with  hidden  lines  removed  from  the  drawing.  This
improves  the  understanding  of  complicated
objects.  It  is  also  possible  to  cut  the  displayed
volumes  with  various  shapes  (boxes,  cones,  tubes
and  spheres)  in  order  to  visualise  the  internals
of  a  detector  element.  The  surfaces  of  the
volumes  drawn  can  be  filled  with  colour,  either
solid  or  shaded  according  to  a  scan-line  based
lighting  algorithm.  A  more  sophisticated  surface
rendering  algorithm  is  now  being  developed  but  it
will  be  available  only  in  the  next  version  of  the
program.


Almost  all  drawing  commands  can  be  executed
either  by  calling  a  routine  from  the  user
application  or  by  issuing  a  command  when  running
GEANT  with  the  standard  interactive  interface.
Several  interactive  tools  (ZOOM,  LENS)  have  been
developed  to  analyse  in  detail  the  various  parts
of  the  detectors.  The  interactive  MOVE  facility
allows  the  rotation,  translation  and  zooming  in
real  time  for  simple  components  of  the  detectors.
Some  of  these  commands  are  only  available  in  the
interactive  interface.  These  are  described
briefly  in  [DRAW500]  and  more  extensively  in  the
[XINT]  section.


A  user  interface  based  on  X-Windows  and  Motif  is
also  available  mainly  on  Unix  workstations.
Details  of  this  interface  are  described  in
[DRAW510].


Various  graphical  options  can  be  set  via  the
GSATT  and  GDOPT  routines.


Every  detector  component  can  be  visualised  either
in  orthonormal  projection  or  in  perspective
(routines  GDRAW  and  GDRVOL).  Sections  of  the
volumes  and  of  their  descendents  can  be
visualised  as  well  (routines  GDRAWX  and  GDRAWC).


The  hierarchical  relations  of  the  various  volumes
which  compose  the  detector  can  be  visualised  via
the  GDTREE  routine.  In  the  interactive  interface
the  user  can  select  one  of  the  volumes  which  are
nodes  of  the  tree  with  the  mouse,  and  display  the
characteristics  of  the  volume  and  walk  up  and
down  the  logical  tree.


Tracks  and  hits  can  be  drawn  either  alone  or
superimposed  on  the  detector  (routines  GDCHIT,
GDHITS,  GDAHIT,  GDXYZ).  It  is  also  possible  to
draw  the  tracks  while  tracking  is  performed  via
the  routine  GDCXYZ.



 The  drawing  may  be  done  with  hidden-line  removal
 and  with  shading  effects  according  to  the  value
 of  the  options  HIDE  and  SHAD  (see  next  section).


 Drawing  complicated  detectors  can  be  a  lengthy
 process  even  on  a  fast  machine.  In  particular,
 when  graphics  options  like  hidden  line  removal  or
 surface  shading  are  requested  and  many  volumes
 are  involved,  the  complete  drawing  can  take
 several  minutes  on  the  most  powerful
 workstations.  To  alleviate  this  problem  drawings
 can  be  stored  in  memory  in  so  called  view  banks.
 The  routines  involved  are  GDOPEN,  GDCLOS,  GDSHOW
 and  GDELET,  and  the  corresponding  interactive
 commands  (DOPEN,  DCLOSE,  DSHOW,  DELETE).  These
 banks  can  then  be  redisplayed  quickly.  They  can
 also  be  written  on  disk  and  read  back.


 Attributes  like  colour  (GDCOL)  and  line  width
 (GDLW)  can  be  globally  set  for  all  2D  drawings
 (i.e.  text,  vectors,  man,  etc.);  such  attributes
 do  not  affect  the  volume  attributes  that  can  be
 set  by  the  GSATT  routine  with  COLO  or  LWID  option.


 The  user  can  control  some  drawing  options
 (GDOPT),  by  selecting,  for  instance,  to  have
 either  parallel  or  perspective  projection,
 either  Y-Z  or  R-Z  projection,  etc.


 The  geometrical  dimensions  of  an  existing  volume
 can  be  changed  via  the  routine  GEDITV.


 Various  service  routines  allow  the  drawing  of  the
 profile  of  a  human  figure,  the  axis,  the  scale  of
 the  dimension  of  the  drawing  and  so  on.  These  are
 described  in  [DRAW400].

 <H2>The  shading  algorithm</H2>


 <PRE>


 In  GEANT  3.16  a  new  shading  algorithm  has  been
 introduced  which  is  10  to  100  times  faster  than
 the  algorithm  which  was  implemented  in  GEANT
 3.15.  In  the  new  algorithm  the  search  for  the
 visible  portions  of  all  the  faces  of  every  volume
 is  performed  in  the  following  steps:


1.      the  vertices  of  each  face  are  transformed  from
        the  MARS  to  the  screen  reference  system.  In
        this  way  the  dimensions  of  the  face  are  of  the
        order  of  magnitude  of  centimeters.
2.      in  the  screen  reference  system  the  face  is
        filled  with  horizontal  lines  scan-lines



        according  to  the  desired  resolution.
3.      These  lines  are  then  transformed  back  in  the
        MARS,  where  the  hidden  line  removal  technique
        is  used  to  find  their  visible  portions.
4.      The  colour  luminosity  is  chosen  as  a  function
        of  the  angle  between  the  normal  to  the  surface
        and  the  line  of  view  which  is  considered  to  be
        also  the  line  of  illumination.
5.      The  visible  portions  of  the  lines  are  finally
        transformed  into  the  screen  reference  system
        and  drawn  with  the  calculated  luminosity  so
        that  they  fill  only  the  visible  part  of  each
        face.


 The  resulting  picture  can  be  saved  into  GEANT
 view  banks  or  HIGZ  picture  files.

 <H2>  Summary</H2>


 <PRE>


 The  best  way  to  initialise  the  drawing  package  is
 to  call  the  HPLOT    initialisation  routine  HPLINT.
 This  will  work  independently  of  the  basic  graphic
 package  used.  The  reader  should  consult  the  HPLOT
 documentation  for  more  information  on  this
 routine.  The  drawing  package  is  initialised  by:


 HPLINT           to  initialise  the  basic  graphics  package
                  and  the  HPLOT  package;
 GDINIT           to  initialise  the  GEANT  drawing  package.


 The  main  drawing  routines  are:


 GDRAW            to  draw  a  projection  view  of  the  detector
                  --  Case  1
 GDRVOL           to  draw  a  projection  view  of  the  detector
                  --  Case  2
 GDRAWC           to  draw  a  cut  view  of  the  detector  (along
                  one  axis)
 GDRAWX           to  draw  a  cut  view  of  the  detector  (from  any
                  point)
 GDXYZ            to  draw  tracks  at  the  end  of  the  event
 GDCXYZ           to  draw  tracks  at  tracking  time
 GDPART           to  draw  particle  names  and  track  numbers  at
                  end  of  tracks

 GDCHIT           to  draw  hits  for  calorimeter  type  detectors

 modelled  are:



GDTREE           to  draw  a  picture  with  the  geometrical  tree

Routines  that  perform  control  operations  on  view
banks  are:


GDOPEN              to  open  a  given  view  bank,  identified  by  a
                    view  number;  in  this  way  we  enter  in  bank
                    mode
GDCLOS              to  close  the  current  view  bank,  i.e.  the
                    last  one  opened,  and  restore  screen  mode
GDSHOW              to  show  all  graphics  information
                    contained  in  a  given  view  bank
GDLENS              to  scan  interactively  the  drawing
                    contained  in  the  view  bank
GDELET              to  delete  a  given  view  bank  from  memory


Routines  that  allow  the  visualisation  of  the
