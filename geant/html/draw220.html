</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Drawing  volume
specifications</H2>


<PRE>    The  geometrical  parameters  of  the  volumes
can  be  displayed  via  the  GDSPEC  routine
(corresponding  to  the  DSPEC  interactive
command).  This  facility  provides  a  detailed
picture  of  a  particular  piece  of  the  detector.
The  set  of  geometrical  specifications  of  all  the
descendants  of  a  given  node  on  the  tree,  can  be
obtained  each  on  a  separate  picture  with  the
routine  GDFSPC  (DFSPC  interactive  command).



       CALL  GDSPEC                         (CHNAME)



CHNAME                    (CHARACTER*4)  volume  name;


Draws  a  picture  showing  all  specifications  for  a
given  volume.  An  example  of  use  of  GDSPEC  can  be
found  in  Fig.  ??    .

The  following  information  on  the  volume  are
presented  in  a  single  frame:


   *   the  volume  daughters  (one  level  down  in  the
       geometrical  tree);
   *   a  space  view  of  the  volume  (with  theta         =45  and
       phi      =135);
   *   a  front  view  cut;
   *   a  side  view  cut;
   *   the  axes  of  the  local  coordinate  system;
   *   a  human  figure;
   *   the  scale;
   *   the  shape  type;
   *   all  the  numerical  parameters  that  define  the
       volume.


In  drawing  the  volumes  GDSPEC  turns  on  the  sets
visibility  ('SEEN')  attribute  for  the  volume



CHNAME  itself  and  its  direct  descendents.  The
setting  of  drawing  options  (HIDE,  CVOL,  FILL  . . .    )
will  be  respected,  allowing  to  customise  the
drawing.  An  example  is  shown  in  Fig.  ??    .

       CALL  GDFSPC                         (CHNAME,ISORT,INTER)



Draws  on  separate  pictures  the  full  set  of  GDSPEC
for  the  geometrical  tree  starting  from  CHNAME,
i.e.  calls  GDSPEC  for  the  volume  CHNAME  and  for
all  its  descendants.


CHNAME                    (CHARACTER*4)  volume  name;
ISORT                     (INTEGER)  alphabetic  sorting  flag;

                          = 1           all  the  volumes  will  be  drawn  in
                                        ascending  alphabetic  order
                                        according  to  their  name;
                          6= 1          the  volumes  will  be  drawn  in  the
                                        order  in  which  they  have  been
                                        created;

INTER                     (INTEGER)  interactive/batch  version
                          flag;

                          = 1           the  routine  will  prompt  the  user  at
                                        each  plot  before  doing  a  clear
                                        screen;
                          6= 0          the  routine  will  clear
                                        automatically  the  screen  before
                                        starting  a  new  frame.

                          Note:  INTER  should  be  set  to  1  when
                          using  the  interactive  version  of  GEANT
                          and  to  any  other  value  when  using  a
                          batch  version.
