Note:  Common  /GCMULO/  contains  an  array  ELOW(200)
(see  [CONS199])  with  NEK1  kinetic  energy  values
ranging  from  EKMIN  to  EKMAX.  GPHYSI  initialises
by  default  the  first  91  locations  of  ELOW  with

                            -5                            4
values  of  energy  from  10        GeV  (10  keV)  to  10     GeV
(10  TeV)  equally  spaced  on  logarithmic  scale.
This  can  be  controlled  by  the  user  via  the  data
record  or  the  interactive  command  ERAN
([BASE040]).  ELOW  can  be  used  as  the  input
argument  TKIN,  e.g.:
CALL  GFTMAT  (10,  1,'PHOT',NEK1,  ELOW  ,VALUE,  PCUT,  IXST)


will  return  in  array  VALUE  the  photoelectric
cross-section  in  material  number  10.



       CALL  GPLMAT                         (IMATE,IPART,CHMECA,KDIM,TKIN,IDM)



Plot  and  interpolate  the  dE/ dx  and  cross-sections
tabulated  in  material  banks  corresponding  to  a
given  array  of  kinetic  energy  bins.  The
mechanisms  are  the  same  as  the  previous  routine.
If  the  mechanism  name  is  'ALL',  then  all  the
mechanisms  will  be  plotted.



The  first  five  parameters  have  the  same  meaning
as  in  the  previous  routine  and:


IDM                       (INTEGER)  treatment  of  the  created
                          histogram(s):

                          >0         fill,  print,  keep  histogram(s);
                          = 0        fill,  print,  delete  histogram(s);
                          <0         fill,  noprint,  keep  histogram(s).


The  result  is  not  returned  to  the  user  as  is  the
case  in  the  previous  routine  but  it  is  put  in  an
HBOOK  histogram.  The  HBOOK  package  needs  to  be
initialised  by  the  user  via  the  routine  HLIMIT,
see  [BASE100]  for  more  information.  The  histogram
identifier  is  calculated  as:
10000*IMATE+100*IPART+IMECA  where  IMECA  is  the
mechanism  code  listed  above.



       CALL  GPRMAT                         (IMATE,IPART,CHMECA,KDIM,TKIN)



Print  and  interpolate  the  dE/ dx  and
cross-sections  tabulated  in  material  banks
corresponding  to  a  given  array  of  kinetic  energy
bins.  The  mechanisms  are  the  same  as  the  previous
routine.  If  the  mechanism  name  is  'ALL',  then  all
the  mechanisms  will  be  printed.


The  result  is  printed  in  the  form  of  a  table.


The  five  parameters  have  the  same  meaning  as  in
the  previous  routine.
