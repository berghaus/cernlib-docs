The  relative  position  of  a  volume  inside  its
mother  is  expressed  in  GEANT  by  a  translation
vector  and  a  rotation  matrix  which  are  arguments
of  the  routines  GSPOS  and  GSPOSP.  The  rotation
matrix  expresses  the  transformation  from  the
Mother  Reference  System  to  the  Daughter  Reference
System.


A  rotation  matrix  is  described  to  GEANT  by  giving
the  polar  and  azimuthal  angles  of  the  axes  of  the
DRS  (x', y', z')  in  the  MRS  via  the  routine  GSROTM.



       CALL  GSROTM                         (IROT,THETA1,PHI1,THETA2,PHI2,THETA3,PHI3)



IROT                      (INTEGER)  number  of  the  rotation
                          matrix;
THETA1                    (REAL)  polar  angle  for  axis  x';
PHI1                      (REAL)  azimuthal  angle  for  axis  x';
THETA2                    (REAL)  polar  angle  for  axis  y';
THI2                      (REAL)  azimuthal  angle  for  axis  y';
THETA3                    (REAL)  polar  angle  for  axis  z';
PHI3                      (REAL)  azimuthal  angle  for  axis  z'.


Stores  rotation  matrix  IROT  in  the  data  structure
JROTM.  If  the  matrix  is  not  orthonormal,  it  will
be  corrected  by  setting  y' ? x'  and  then  z' = x' x y'.
A  warning  message  is  printed  in  this  case.


Note:  the  angles  THETA  and  PHI  must  be  given  in
degrees.

Examples  of  use  The  unit  matrix  is  defined  in  the
following  way:



                                                                                o                                                  *
 *         o
                                          theta                   =         90          ;                 phi                =     *
 *      0
     x'           k         x                           1                                                         1
                                                                                o                                                  *
 *        o
.    y'           k         y     ") -    theta                   =         90          ;                 phi                =     *
 *    90            .

                                                        2                                                         2
                                                                                  o                                                *
 *         o
     z'           k         z             theta                   =            0          ;               phi                =     *
 *      0

                                                        3                                                         3



This  is  just  an  example.  There  is  in  fact  no  need
to  define  a  unit  rotation  matrix.  Giving  the
value  0  to  the  rotation  matrix  number  in  the  call
to  GSPOS  and  GSPOSP  is  equivalent  to  a
positioning  without  rotation  and  it  improves
tracking  performance.


                        o
The  result  of  a  90       counterclockwise  rotation
                                 o
around  z,  followed  by  a  90       counterclockwise
rotation  around  the  new  x  is  a  cyclic  shift  of  the
axes:  x- >   z', y- >   x', z- >   y'.  This  is  expressed  by
the  following  rotation  matrix:

Sometimes  the  rotation  matrix  is  known  or  it  can
be  constructed.  In  this  case  the  arguments  to  the
routine  GSROTM  can  be  calculated  with  the  help  of
the  routine  GFANG  in  the  following  way:
           DIMENSION  ROTMAT(3,3),  ROWMAT(3),  PHI(3),  THETA(3)
           LOGICAL  ROTATE
           .
           .
           .
           DO  10  I=1,3
                ROWMAT(1)  =  ROTMAT(I,1)
                ROWMAT(2)  =  ROTMAT(I,2)
                ROWMAT(3)  =  ROTMAT(I,3)
                CALL  GFANG(ROWMAT,COSTH,SINTH,COSPH,SINPH,ROTATE)
                THETA(I)  =  ATAN2(SINTH,COSTH)
                PHI(I)      =  ATAN2(SINPH,COSPH)
    10    CONTINUE


           .
           .  -"sl  Transform  to  degrees"
           .
           CALL  GSROTM(IROT,THETA(1),PHI(1),THETA(2),PHI(2),THETA(3),PHI(3))



       CALL  GPROTM                         (IROT)



Prints  the  rotation  matrix  elements  and  angles.


IROT                      (INTEGER)  rotation  matrix  number:  if
                          IROT=0  all  rotation  matrixes  will  be
                          printed,  if  IROT<0,  matrix  number
                          _IROT_  will  be  printed  without  header
                          information.
