       CALL  GANNII



GANNII  tabulates  the  mean  free  path  at
initialisation  as  a  function  of  the  medium  and  of
the  energy  (see  JMATE  data  structure).  The  energy
binning  is  set  within  the  array  ELOW  (common
block  /GCMULO/)  in  the  routine  GPHYSI.  GANNII  is
called  from  GPHYSI.

For  the  annihilation  into  two  photons  the
cross-section  formula  of  Heitler  is  used.  The
total  cross-section  is  given  by



                                                                                                                                   *
 *                     @

                                                                         2                                           2             *
 *                     @
sigma                          (Z, E)                =         ((Zpi    r   )/ (gamma          + 1))[((gamma             + 4gamma  *
 *        + 1)/ (gamma @
              2gamma
                                                                         0



                                        r            =         classical  electron  radius
                                         0



For  compounds,  the  cross-section  is  calculated
using  an  effective  atomic  number  as  explained  in
[PHYS010].



Positrons  can  annihilate  in  a  single  photon  if
the  electron  with  which  it  interacts  is  bound  to  a
nucleus.  The  total  cross-section  for  such  a
process  is



                                                                       2                4     5                                    *
 *                2    @
sigma                          (Z, E)                =         4pi    r   alpha            ((Z   )/ (gamma         beta        (gam*
 *ma          + 1)   ))@
              1gamma
                                                                       0



                                alpha                =         fine  structure  constant



In  the  derivation  of  this  formula,  only  the
interactions  with  the  K-shell  electrons  are  taken

                                                      5
into  account.  As  the  cross-section  depends  on  Z   ,
a  special  value  of  Z           is  computed  in  GPROBI:
                        eff


                                                                          5
                                  Z          = sum       ((p   )/ (A   ))Z                                                  (3)
                                   eff             i        i       i



The  notation  of  [PHYS010]  is  used.


The  total  cross-section  for  the  positron
annihilation  is  sigma          = sigma                           + sigma                          .
                                                 2gamma                            1gamma

The  value  of  sigma                            is  at  it  largest  for
                              1gamma

heavy  materials,  for  example,  it  is    20  %  of
sigma           for  a  positron  of  440  keV  of  kinetic  energy
in  lead.  For  lower  and  higher  energies  the
probability  is  lower.
