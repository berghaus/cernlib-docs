       CALL  GSDVX                       (CHNAME,CHMOTH,NDIV,IAXIS,STEP,C0,NUMED,NDVMAX)



Divide  a  volume  in  a  given  number  of  parts  along  a
direction,  with  a  given  step  starting  from  an
offset.


CHNAME                    (CHARACTER*4)  a  unique  name  for  the
                          volume  to  be  generated  by  subdivision  of
                          the  mother  volume;
CHMOTH                    (CHARACTER*4)  volume  that  has  to  be
                          subdivided;
NDIV                      (INTEGER)  number  of  divisions  into
                          which  the  mother  volume  is  to  be
                          divided;
IAXIS                     (INTEGER)  axis  of  the  division.
STEP                      (REAL)  size  of  the  divisions  --  this
                          value  can  be  in  centimeters  or  degrees
                          according  to  the  value  of  IAXIS;
C0                        (REAL)  offset  where  division  should
                          start  --  this  value  can  be  in
                          centimeters  or  degrees  according  to  the
                          value  of  IAXIS;
NUMED                     (INTEGER)  medium  number  of  the
                          divisions  --  this  can  be  different  from
                          the  one  of  the  mother,  as  the  division
                          cells  may  leave  a  portion  of  the  mother
                          undivided  (see  below)  --  if  NUMED  < =   0
                          the  medium  of  the  mother;
NDVMX                     (INTEGER)  expected  (maximum)  number  of
                          divisions  --  if  < =   0  or  >255,  255  is
                          assumed.


For  more  information  on  the  division  mechanism,
see  [GEOM130]  and  [GEOM140].  For  the  moment
either  NDIV  or  STEP  must  be  set  negative  or  0,  so
that  they  will  be  computed  from  the  CHMOTH's
size.  The  case  with  both  NDIV  and  STEP  positive  is
not  coded  yet.  It  would  permit  leaving  different



gaps  at  both  ends  of  the  CHMOTH.


Provisionally  the  code  consists  of  a  call  to
either  GSDVN2  or  GSDVT2.



       CALL  GSDVN2                         (CHNAME,CHMOTH,NDIV,IAXIS,C0,NUMED)



Divide  a  volume  in  a  given  number  of  parts  along  a
direction,  starting  from  an  offset.


CHNAME                    (CHARACTER*4)  a  unique  name  for  the
                          volume  to  be  generated  by  subdivision  of
                          the  mother  volume;
CHMOTH                    (CHARACTER*4)  volume  that  has  to  be
                          subdivided;
NDIV                      (INTEGER)  number  of  divisions  into
                          which  the  mother  volume  is  to  be
                          divided;
IAXIS                     (INTEGER)  axis  of  the  division.
C0                        (REAL)  offset  where  division  should
                          start  --  this  value  can  be  in
                          centimeters  or  degrees  according  to  the
                          value  of  IAXIS;
NUMED                     (INTEGER)  medium  number  of  the
                          divisions  --  this  can  be  different  from
                          the  one  of  the  mother,  as  the  division
                          cells  may  leave  a  portion  of  the  mother
                          undivided  (see  below)  --  if  NUMED  < =   0
                          the  medium  of  the  mother;


The  divisions  start  at  the  user  specified
coordinate  value  and  extend  to  the  end  of  the
volume.  The  range  from  this  offset  to  the  upper
coordinate  limit  of  the  mother  volume  will  be
divided  into  the  supplied  number  of  cells.  In  the
case  of  phi       division  of  a  complete  tube  or  cone,
the  whole  360  degrees  will  be  divided  into  the
user-supplied  number  of  slices  no  matter  what  the
origin  is.  Specifying  an  origin  for  the  division,
in  this  case,  just  moves  the  division  boundaries.
This  can  be  useful  to  avoid  a  rotation.  In  all
other  cases  the  search  routines  will  assume  that
a  point  is  in  the  mother  if  the  coordinate  value
is  less  than  the  value  of  the  supplied  offset.



       CALL  GSDVT2                         (CHNAME,CHMOTH,STEP,IAXIS,C0,NUMED,NDVMX)



Divide  a  volume  along  a  direction  with  a  given
step  starting  from  an  offset.



CHNAME                    (CHARACTER*4)  a  unique  name  for  the
                          volume  to  be  generated  by  subdivision  of
                          the  mother  volume;
CHMOTH                    (CHARACTER*4)  volume  that  has  to  be
                          subdivided;
STEP                      (REAL)  size  of  the  divisions  --  this
                          value  can  be  in  centimeters  or  degrees
                          according  to  the  value  of  IAXIS;
IAXIS                     (INTEGER)  axis  of  the  division;
C0                        (REAL)  offset  where  division  should
                          start  --  this  value  can  be  in
                          centimeters  or  degrees  according  to  the
                          value  of  IAXIS;
NUMED                     (INTEGER)  medium  number  of  the
                          divisions  --  this  can  be  different  from
                          the  one  of  the  mother,  as  the  division
                          cells  may  leave  a  portion  of  the  mother
                          undivided  (see  below)  --  if  NUMED  < =   0
                          the  medium  of  the  mother;
NDVMX                     (INTEGER)  expected  (maximum)  number  of
                          divisions  --  if  < =   0  or  >255,  255  is
                          assumed.


The  division  start  at  the  user-specified
coordinate  value  and  extend  to  the  end  of  the
volume.  The  range  from  origin  to  upper  coordinate
limit  of  the  mother  volume  is  divided  in  sections
of  the  user  supplied  step.  If  the  step  is  such
that  the  range  of  the  mother  cannot  be  filled  with
cells,  the  largest  possible  number  of  cells  is
created.  The  excess  space  up  to  the  end  of  the
mother  volume  will  be  assumed  to  belong  to  the
mother.


In  the  case  of  phi       division  of  a  complete  tube  or
cone,  the  whole  360  degrees  will  be  filled  with
slices,  no  matter  what  the  origin  is.  Specifying
an  origin  for  the  division,  in  this  case,  just
moves  the  division  boundaries.  This  can  be  useful
to  avoid  a  rotation.


In  all  other  cases  the  search  routines  will
assume  a  point  is  just  in  the  mother  if  the
coordinate  value  is  less  than  the  value  of  the
user  supplied  origin.
