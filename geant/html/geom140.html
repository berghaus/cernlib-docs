</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Division  of  a  Volume  into  cells
of  a  given  size</H2>


<PRE>


This  routine  creates  new  volumes  from  a  mother  by
divisions  of  a  given  step.



       CALL  GSDVT                       (CHNAME,CHMOTH,STEP,IAXIS,NUMED,NDVMX)



CHNAME                    (CHARACTER*4)  a  unique  name  for  the
                          volume  to  be  generated  by  subdivision  of
                          the  mother  volume;
CHMOTH                    (CHARACTER*4)  volume  that  has  to  be
                          subdivided;
STEP                      (REAL)  size  of  the  divisions  --  this
                          value  can  be  in  centimeters  or  degrees
                          according  to  the  value  of  IAXIS;
IAXIS                     (INTEGER)  axis  of  the  division.
NUMED                     (INTEGER)  medium  number  of  the
                          divisions  --  this  can  be  different  from
                          the  one  of  the  mother,  as  the  division
                          cells  may  leave  a  portion  of  the  mother
                          undivided  (see  below)  --  if  NUMED  < =   0
                          the  medium  of  the  mother;
NDVMX                     (INTEGER)  expected  (maximum)  number  of
                          divisions  --  if  < =   0  or  >255,  255  is
                          assumed.


The  full  range  of  the  mother  will  be  divided  in
sections  of  the  user  supplied  step.  If  the  step  is
such  that  the  mother  cannot  be  divided  exactly,
the  largest  possible  number  of  divisions  will  be
generated,  the  excess  space  will  be  equally
divided  between  each  end  of  the  range  of  the
mother.  These  extra  spaces  will  be  assumed  to
belong  to  the  mother.


For  more  information  on  the  division  in  general,
see  [GEOM130].
