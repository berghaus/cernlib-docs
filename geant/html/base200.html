       CALL  GRUN



Main  routine  to  control  a  run  of  events.  The
following  flow  chart  is  only  valid  for  the  batch
execution  mode.  For  interactive  applications,
see  section  XINT.  A  schematic  description  of  the
routine  is  shown  in  fig.  ??    .

       CALL  GTRIGI



Initialisation  routine  for  event  processing:


   *   resets  to  0  the  flag  IEOTRI  in  /GCFLAG/  and  the
       counters  NTRACK  and  NVERTX  in  /GCNUM/;
   *   sets  the  debug  flag  IDEBUG  in  /GCFLAG/  to  the
       value  required  for  the  current  event;
   *   creates  a  default  header  bank  JHEAD  for  current
       event  [BASE299];
   *   prints  the  sequence  number,  the  event  number
       and  the  random  number  generator  seeds,  under
       control  of  the  flag  ITEST  (data  record  DEBU).



       CALL  GTRIG



Steering  routine  to  process  one  event  (trigger).
A  schematic  description  of  the  routine  is  shown
in  fig.  ??    .



 <A  HREF=  "  file=eps/base200-2.eps,width=16cm  "  >

Default  routines  provided  by  GEANT  are  dummy.



       CALL  GTRIGC



The  event  division  IXDIV  is  cleared.  The  space
used  by  the  current  event  may  be  used  by  the  next
one.
