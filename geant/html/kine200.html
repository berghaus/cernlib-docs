 </PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Interface  to  the  Lund  Monte
 Carlo</H2>


 <PRE>


 GEANT  contains  a  simple  interface  to  the  JETSET
 Monte  Carlo  generator  .  This  interface  is
 composed  by  an  initialisation  routine  and  an
 event  generation  routine.



        CALL  GLUNDI



 This  is  the  initialisation  routine  which  should
 be  called  before  the  call  to  GFFGO,  as  it  defines
 the  data  record  LUND.  This  routine  performs  the
 following  actions:



                      p  ===
1.      sets  ECLUND=    s  = 92. 25  GeV;
2.      sets  IFLUND= 0;
3.      activates  initial  state  radiative  effects
        MSTJ(107)=  1;

                                     0
4.      declares  some  particles  (K   ,  Sigma            ,  Xi       ,

                                     s

                         0                   -
        Lambda              ,  Omega            )  to  be  stable  in  JETSET  so  that
        GEANT  can  handle  their  tracking  and  decays:
                        MDCY(LUCOMP(310)  ,1)=0
                        MDCY(LUCOMP(3222),1)=0
                        MDCY(LUCOMP(3112),1)=0
                        MDCY(LUCOMP(3322),1)=0
                        MDCY(LUCOMP(3312),1)=0
                        MDCY(LUCOMP(3122),1)=0
                        MDCY(LUCOMP(3334),1)=0


 Variables  ECLUND,  total  energy  in  the  CMS,  and
 IFLUND,  quark  flavours  produced,  are  used  as
 arguments  for  LUEEVT  called  by  GLUND  and  they  can
 be  changed  via  the  LUND  data  record  (see
 [BASE040]).



       CALL  GLUND



Generate  a  e-e+collision  via  the  JETSET
MonteCarlo  and  stores  the  resulting  final  state
particles  for  transport  by  GEANT.  All  particles
are  attached  to  a  vertex  in  (0.,0.,0.).  The  K  and
P  arrays  containing  the  full  JETSET  event  are
copied  in  the  user  buffer  of  the  generated
vertex,  with  the  K  variables  converted  into  REAL
numbers.  The  content  of  the  user  buffer  is  the
following:



           UBUF(         1)                                 527. 0



           UBUF(         2)             N  number  of  particles



             UBUF(         3)                      K(1,1)



             UBUF(         4)                      K(1,2)



             UBUF(         5)                      K(1,3)



             UBUF(         6)                      K(1,4)



             UBUF(         7)                      K(1,5)
        .                                                              "                                  N  times

             UBUF(         8)                      P(1,1)



             UBUF(         9)                      P(1,2)



             UBUF(         10)                     P(1,3)



             UBUF(         11)                     P(1,4)



             UBUF(         12)                     P(1,5)
