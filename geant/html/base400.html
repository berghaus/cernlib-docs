</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Debugging  facilities</H2>


<PRE>    The  flags  IDEBUG,  ITEST  and  ISWIT(1-10)
are  available  to  in  the  common  /GCFLAG/  for  debug
control  [BASE030].  The  array  ISWIT  is  filled
through  the  data  record  SWIT.  Some  flags  are  used
by  GHEISHA  [PHYS510]  and  by  the  routine  GDEBUG.


The  flag  IDEBUG  is  set  to  1  in  GTRIGI  for  the
events  with  sequence  number  from  IDEMIN  to
IDEMAX,  as  specified  by  the  user  on  the  data
record  DEBU.  If  IDEMIN  is  negative,  debug  is
activated  also  in  the  initialisation  phase.


The  flag  ITEST,  set  by  the  user  via  the  data
record  DEBU,  is  also  used  by  GTRIGI.  The  sequence
number,  the  event  number  and  the  random  numbers
seeds  are  printed  at  the  beginning  of  each  event
every  ITEST  from  IDEMIN  to  IDEMAX.

<H2>Debug  of  data  structures</H2>


<PRE>


The  contents  of  the  data  structures  can  be  dumped
by  the  routine



       CALL  GPRINT                         (CHNAME,NUMB)



CHNAME                    (CHARACTER*4)  name  of  a  top  level  data
                          structure;
NUMB                      (INTEGER)  number  of  the  substructure  to
                          be  printed,  0  for  all.


Examples


   *   CALL  GPRINT('KINE',0)  prints  all  banks  JKINE;
   *   CALL  GPRINT('KINE',8)  prints  JKINE  bank  for
       track  8;
   *   CALL  GPRINT('VOLU',0)  prints  all  existing
       volumes.


The  following  names  are  recognised:



DIGI,HITS,KINE,MATE,VOLU,ROTM,SETS,TMED,PART,VERT,JXYZ


GPRINT  calls  selectively  the  routines:



    GPDIGI('*','*')                                  GPHITS('*','*')                                  GPKINE(NUMB)                 *
 *                     @



    GPVOLU(NUMB)                                     GPROTM(NUMB)                                     GPSETS('*','*')              *
 *                     @



    GPPART(NUMB)                                     GPVERT(NUMB)                                     GPJXYZ(NUMB)



These  routines  can  be  called  directly  by  the
user.  In  case  of  SETS,  HITS  and  DIGI  the  content
of  all  detectors  of  all  sets  will  be  printed,  so
NUMB  is  irrelevant.

<H2>Debug  of  events</H2>


<PRE>


The  development  of  an  event  can  be  followed  via
the  routine:



       CALL  GDEBUG



which  operates  under  the  control  of  the  ISWIT
array.  It  is  the  user  responsibility  to  call  this
routine  from  GUSTEP.  If  the  DEBUG  flag  is  active,
the  routine  will  perform  as  follows:


ISWIT(1)

                 2          the  content  of  the  temporary  stack  for
                            secondaries  in  the  common  /GCKING/  is
                            printed;

ISWIT(2)

                 1          the  current  point  of  the  track  is
                            stored  in  the  JDXYZ  bank  via  the
                            routine  GSXYZ;
                 2          the  current  information  on  the  track  is
                            printed  via  the  routine  GPCXYZ;
                 3          the  current  step  is  drawn  via  the
                            routine  GDCXYZ;
                 4          the  current  point  of  the  track  is
                            stored  in  the  JDXYZ  bank  via  the
                            routine  GSXYZ.  When  the  particle  stops
                            the  track  is  drawn  via  the  routine
                            GDTRAK  and  the  space  occupied  by  the



                            track  in  the  structure  JDXYZ  released;

ISWIT(3)

                 1          the  current  point  of  the  track  is
                            stored  in  the  JDXYZ  bank  via  the
                            routine  GSXYZ.
