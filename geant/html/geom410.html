</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Ordering  the  contents  of  a
volume</H2>


<PRE>


In  the  case  of  a  mother  volume  containing  a  large
number  of  daughters,  tracking  can  be  rather  slow.
This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  each  time  GEANT
requires  to  know  in  which  daughter  it  is  or  will
be  tracking,  it  search  through  the  whole  list  of
daughter  volumes.  This  is  done  by  GEANT  creating
for  every  daughter  volume  a  list  which  contain
pointers  to  all  the  daughters  of  the  same  mother.


Clearly  this  may  be  avoided,  because  at  any  step
of  tracking,  the  coordinates  and  direction
cosines  of  the  current  step  are  known.  From  this
and  the  knowledge  of  the  geometry,  a  restricted
list  of  daughter  volumes  to  be  searched  can  be
built.  This  can  be  accomplished  in  GEANT  in  two
ways,  which  are  described  in  this  chapter.


Note:  the  user  must  be  aware  that  the  following
routines  alter  the  default  search  list  of
daughters  of  a  given  mother.  A  user  mistake  can
cause  wrong  transport  because  GEANT  does  not  make
any  check  on  the  correctness  of  the  list  of
neighbours  provided  by  the  user.

Static  ordering



       CALL  GSNEXT                         (CHMOTH,IN,NLIST,LIST)



CHMOTH                    (CHARACTER*4)  name  of  the  mother  volume
                          to  be  ordered;
IN                        (INTEGER)  number  of  the  content  for
                          which  a  list  is  established;



NLIST                     (INTEGER)  number  of  neighbours  to  be
                          considered  during  tracking;
LIST                      (INTEGER)  list  of  neighbours  to  volume
                          IN.


This  routine  stores  a  given  ordered  LIST  of  NLIST

                                                     th
daughter  volumes  to  search  when  leaving  the  IN
daughter  of  the  mother  volume  CHMOTH.


If  IN=0,  for  each  content,  GSNEXT  builds  a  list
limited  to  the  contents  IN+1  (if  it  exists),  IN-1
(if  it  exists)  and  IN  itself.



       CALL  GSNEAR                         (CHMOTH,IN,NLIST,LIST)



CHMOTH                    (CHARACTER*4)  name  of  the  mother  volume
                          to  be  ordered;
IN                        (INTEGER)  number  of  the  content  for
                          which  a  list  is  established;
NLIST                     (INTEGER)  number  of  neighbours  to  be
                          considered  during  tracking;
LIST                      (INTEGER)  list  of  neighbours  to  volume
                          IN.


This  routine  stores  a  given  ordered  LIST  of  NLIST

                                                     th
daughter  volumes  to  search  when  leaving  the  IN
daughter  of  the  mother  volume  CHMOTH.


If  LIST(1)=0  the  particle  is  back  into  the  mother

                      th
when  leaving  the  IN        daughter.  This  means  that

       th
the  IN        is  not  contiguous  to  any  other  daughter
or  to  the  boundary  of  the  mother.


If  IN=-1,  the  mother  does  not  have  contents
contiguous  to  its  boundaries  (status  bit  4  set  in
mother  volume  bank  for  action  in  GGCLOS).


If  IN=0  for  each  content  GSNEAR  sets  LIST(1)=0.


GSNEAR  must  be  called  after  all  contents  have
been  position  (  except  when  IN=-1)

Dynamic  ordering


The  list  of  neighbours  to  search  when  exiting

             th
from  the  IN        content  may  depend  also  on  the
direction  and  position  of  the  particle.  In  case
where  it  is  necessary,  for  performance  reasons,
to  exploit  also  this  information,  GEANT  offers
the  possibility  to  the  user  to  build  a  dynamic
search  list.



       CALL  GSUNEA                         (CHNAME,ISEARC)



CHNAME                    (CHARACTER*4)  name  of  the  volume  where
                          the  user  search  has  to  be  activated;
ISEARCH                   (INTEGER)  specifies  the  kind  of  search
                          list  to  be  used:  a  positive  value  must
                          be  specified  with  this  routine  to
                          activate  user  search  lists.


This  routine  should  be  called  once  for  every
volume  where  user  volume  search  is  activated.



       CALL  GUNEAR                         (ISEARC,ICALL,XC,JNEAR)



ISEARCH                   (INTEGER)  number  associated  to  the
                          volume  in  which  the  user  search  is  used,
                          it  is  the  same  number  set  by  the  user
                          with  GSUNEA;
ICALL                     (INTEGER)  type  of  question  that  the  list
                          of  volumes  must  answer:

                          1             GMEDIA-like  call,  where  am  I?
                          2             GTNEXT-like  call,  where  can  I  go?

XC                        (REAL)  array  of  6  containing  the
                          position  and  the  direction  cosines  of
                          the  particle  (x,  y,  z,  p   / p,  p   / p,
                                                       x         y

                          p   / p);
                           x

JNEAR                     (INTEGER)  pointer  to  the  volume  list
                          bank  which  has  to  be  filled  by  the  user;


The  list  of  volumes  where  GEANT  has  to  search  to
answer  the  question  specified  by  ICALL  is
returned  by  the  user  starting  at  Q(JNEAR+1.  GEANT
will  only  look  at  the  volumes  specified  by  the
user  and  in  the  order  in  which  they  appear  in  the



list.  Daughters  are  numbered  from  1  to  N
according  to  the  order  with  which  they  have  been
positioned  in  the  mother.  The  list  should  be
filled  in  the  following  way:



    IQ(JNEAR+1)                                =         N,  number  of  volumes  in  the  list



    IQ(JNEAR+1+1)                              =         number  of  the  first  daughter  to  search



    IQ(JNEAR+1+2)                              =         number  of  the  second  daughter  to  search



    .



    .



    .

                                                                           th
    IQ(JNEAR+1+N)                              =         number  of  the  N        daughter  to  search



The  user  should  be  aware  that  this  routine  is
called  very  often,  almost  at  every  tracking  step,
so  it  should  be  coded  with  the  maximum  efficiency
in  mind.  An  example  of  GUNEAR  could  be  the
following:
           SUBROUTINE  GUNEAR(ISEARC,ICALL,XC,JNEAR)
*---                         Make  sure  to  add  GEANT  main  store

                MYLIST(1)  =  ....
                .
                .
                .
                MYLIST(N)  =  ....
           ELSE
*---                         Build  a  list  using  XC  and  ISEARC  for  a  GTNEXT  type  call

                MYLIST(1)  =  ....
                .
                .
                .
                MYLIST(N)  =  ....
           ENDIF
*---                         Return  the  information  to  GEANT
