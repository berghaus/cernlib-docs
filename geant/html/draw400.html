       CALL  GDOPT                       (CHOPT,CHVAL)



CHOPT                     (CHARACTER*4)  option  to  be  set;
CHVAL                     (CHARACTER*4)  value  to  be  assigned  to
                          the  option.


Drawing  options  can  be  set  via  the  routine  GDOPT
(corresponding  to  the  DOPT  interactive  command).
The  possible  value  of  CHOPT  and  of  CHVAL  are  the
following:


PROJ                      selects  the  type  of  projection,  it  can
                          have  the  following  values:

                          PARA               orthographic  parallel
                                             projection  (the  default);
                          PERS               perspective  projection.

THRZ                      acronym  for  Tracks  and  Hits  in  a  Radius
                          versus  Z  projection,  where  R  is  the
                          vertical  axis  of  the  drawing  and  Z  the
                          horizontal  one.  If  a  cut  view  has  been
                          drawn  with  the  following  parameters:

                          X-Z  cut              CUTTHE=90  and  CUTPHI=90  in
                                                GDRAWX  or  icut=2  in  GDRAWC;
                          Y-Z  cut              CUTTHE=90  and  CUTPHI=180  in
                                                GDRAWX  or  icut=1  in  GDRAWC.

                          the  different  values  of  the  option  THRZ
                          have  the  following  effect  on  the  drawing
                          of  hits  and  tracks:

                          360                hits  and  tracks  will  be  rotated
                                             around  Z  onto  the  Z-R,  R>0  half
                                             plane;
                          180                (equivalent  to  ON)  hits  and
                                             tracks  will  be  rotated  around  Z
                                             onto  the  Z-R  plane  by  the  smaller
                                             phi       angle,  so  to  conserve  the
                                             sign  of  their  R-ordinate  (where
                                             R  is  either  X  or  Y;
                          OFF                (the  default)  tracks  and  hits



                                             will  be  projected  from  their
                                             position  in  space  onto  the  plane
                                             R-Z.

                          Note:  when  the  THRZ  option  is  set  to  ON
                          or  180,  particles  originating  in  one
                          half  space  and  crossing  the  horizontal
                          axis  will  be  reflected  back  into  the
                          original  half  space.  If  the  option  360
                          can  be  chosen,  all  tracks  and  hits  are
                          on  the  top  (positive)  half  space.
TRAK                      selects  the  way  tracks  are  drawn.
                          Possible  values:

                          LINE               (the  default)  the  lines  joining
                                             track  points  are  drawn  by  GDXYZ;
                          POIN               only  the  track  points  are  drawn.

HIDE                      selects  the  hidden  line  removal
                          technique  for  the  drawings.  Possible
                          values  are:

                          OFF                (the  default)  hidden  lines  are
                                             not  removed  from  the  drawing:
                                             the  drawing  is  usually  rather
                                             fast,  but  the  result  can  be  quite
                                             messy  if  a  large  number  of
                                             volumes  is  visible;
                          ON                 hidden  lines  are  not  drawn:  if
                                             this  value  is  selected,  the
                                             detector  can  be  exploded
                                             (interactive  command  BOMB),  cut
                                             with  different  shapes
                                             (interactive  command  menu  CVOL),
                                             and  some  parts  can  be  shifted
                                             from  their  original  position
                                             (interactive  command  SHIFT).
                                             Drawing  with  hidden  line  removal
                                             can  be  demanding  in  terms  of  CPU
                                             time  and  memory.  At  the  end  of
                                             each  drawing  the  program
                                             displays  the  memory  used  and  the
                                             statistics  on  the  volume
                                             visibility.  When  the  drawing
                                             requires  more  memory  than
                                             available,  the  program  will
                                             evaluate  and  display  the  number
                                             of  missing  words,  so  that  the
                                             user  can  increase  accordingly
                                             the  size  of  the  ZEBRA  store  in
                                             the  common  /GCBANK/.

SHAD                      when  HIDE  is  ON,  selects  the  shading  and
                          filling  option  for  the  detector's
                          surfaces  that  are  drawn:

                          OFF                (the  default)  no  shading  of  the
                                             surfaces  will  be  performed;
                          ON                 the  volume  surfaces  will  be
                                             filled  according  to  the  value  of

This  routine  sets  the  zoom  parameters  (part  of
the  viewing  parameters  in  common  /GCDRAW/)  that
define  how  objects  will  be  displayed  by  the
subsequent  drawing  operations.  The  zoom  is



computed  around  UZ0,  VZ0  (user  coordinates).  This
point  will  be  moved  to  U0,  V0  in  the  resulting
picture.  ZFU,  ZFV  are  the  zoom  factors
(positive).  If  ZFU  or  ZFV  are  zero,  the  zoom
parameters  are  reset,  and  the  original  viewing  is
restored.

       CALL  GDCOL                       (ICOL)



This  routine  has  been  kept  for  backward
compatibility.  The  appropriate  HIGZ  routines
should  be  called  instead.


ICOL                      (INTEGER)  colour  code  (1,2,. . .     ,8),  it
                          can  be  positive,  negative,  or  zero:

                          >0            to  set  the  colour  permanently;
                          <0            to  set  the  colour  temporarily;
                          =0            to  restore  the  permanent  colour
                                        value.


This  routine  sets  the  colour  code.  For  example  we
can  set  ICOL=-1  to  start  with  colour  1,  then
change  to  ICOL=3  to  set  colour  3,  and  at  the  end
restore  the  original  colour  by  setting  ICOL=0
that  takes  colour  1  again.



       CALL  GDLW                     (LW)



This  routine  has  been  kept  for  backward
compatibility.  The  appropriate  HIGZ  routines
should  be  called  instead.


  LW                      (INTEGER)  line  width  code  (1,2,. . .     ,5),
                          it  can  be  positive,  negative,  or  zero:



                          >0            to  set  the  line  width  permanently;
                          <0            to  set  the  line  width  temporarily;
                          =0            to  restore  the  permanent  line
                                        width  value.


This  routine  sets  the  line  width.  For  example  we
can  set  LW=-1  to  start  with  line  width  1,  then
change  to  LW=3  to  set  line  width  3,  and  at  the  end
restore  the  original  line  width  by  setting  LW=0
that  takes  line  width  1  again.



       CALL  GDCURS                         (U0*,V0*,ICHAR*)



U0                        (REAL)  U  coordinate  of  the  graphics
                          cursor;
V0                        (REAL)  V  coordinate  of  the  graphics
                          cursor;
ICHAR                     (INTEGER)  ASCII  value  of  the  key
                          pressed.


A  graphics  input  is  provided  by  this  routine  to
fetch  the  2D  user  coordinates  of  the  graphics
cursor  on  the  screen.  Interactive  commands  to
zoom,  measure,  or  pick  tracks  or  hits  make  use  of
this  routine.  When  the  routine  is  called  in  the
interactive  version  of  GEANT,  the  present
position  of  the  graphics  cursor  on  the  screen
becomes  visible  and  it  can  be  moved  with  the
mouse.  The  user  then  positions  the  cursor  and
presses  the  left  button.  The  routine  returns  then
in  U0,  V0  the  user  coordinates  of  the  graphics
cursor.  On  terminals  which  do  not  have  the  mouse,
the  graphic  cursor  is  moved  with  the  arrows,  and
the  point  is  acquired  when  any  key,  except
carriage  return,  is  pressed.  In  this  case  the
routine  returns  in  ICHAR  the  ASCII  value  of  the
key  pressed.  If  the  user  types  the  carriage
return,  the  previous  value  is  retained.



       CALL  GDFR3D                         (X,NPOINT,U*,V*)



X                         (REAL)  array  X(3,NPOINT)  of  space
                          points;
NPOINT                    (INTEGER)  number  of  points:

                          >0            X  is  in  the  current  DRS;
                          <0            X  is  in  MARS;

U                         (REAL)  array  of  NPOINT  U  coordinates;
V                         (REAL)  array  of  NPOINT  V  coordinates.



Converts  from  3D  space  coordinates  (either  in
MAster  or  Daughter  Reference  System)  to  the
corresponding  2D  user  coordinates.


This  routine  maps  a  space  point  (X,  Y,  Z  in  a
right-handed  reference  system)  onto  a  plane
perpendicular  to  the  observer's  line  of  sight,
defined  by  the  spherical  angles  theta         ,  phi     :


theta         the  angle  between  the  line  of  sight  and  the  Z
              axis  (0< =    theta         < =   180);
phi           the  angle  between  the  X  axis  and  the
              projection  onto  the  X-Y  plane  of  the  line  of
              sight  (0< =    phi     < =   360).


The  plane  onto  which  the  point  is  mapped  is
actually  the  X-Y  plane  of  the  Projection
Reference  System,  and  the  observer's  line  of
sight  is  the  Z  axis  of  PRS.  The  vertical  axis  on
this  plane  (Y  axis  on  PRS)  is  obtained  by
intersecting  this  plane  with  the  one  of  MARS  or
DRS  containing  the  line  of  sight  and  the  Y  axis.

                          points  in  PRS.


Converts  from  3D  space  coordinates  in  MARS  to  3D
coordinates  in  Projection  Reference  System
(whose  Z  axis  is  along  the  line  of  sight  given  by
theta           and  phi       angles).
