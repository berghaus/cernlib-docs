       CALL  GPFISI



GPFISI  computes  and  stores  in  the  appropriate
bank  (see  JMATE  data  structure)  the  value  of  the
photo-fission  cross  sections  as  a  function  of  the
energy  for  all  the  material  for  which  this
process  is  activated  and  with  230< =    A< =    240.  It  is
called  during  initialisation  by  GPHYSI.



       CALL  GPFIS



GPFIS  is  called  by  the  tracking  routine  GTGAMA  to
generate  the  final  state  of  a  photon-induced
fission.

This  set  of  routines  generates  the  photon-induced
fission  in  the  nuclei  of  heavy  materials.  The
code  is  a  straight  translation  into  the  GEANT
style  of  the  corresponding  code  from  the  GHEISHA
Monte  Carlo  program.


The  information  contained  in  this  chapter  is
mainly  taken  from  the  GHEISHA  manual  to  which  the
user  is  referred  .  In  fissionable  elements  the



inelastic  reaction  of  photons  may  be  accompanied
by  the  fission  of  the  nucleus.  This  channel  is
taken  into  account  only  when  the  nuclear  mass  is
between  230  and  240.  The  fission  cross-section
for  uranium  is  tabulated,  and  for  other  elements
the  parameterisation  of  the  A-dependence  at  3  MeV
neutron  energy  is  used:



                                                                   4/3
                         sigma            (3MeV) =- 67. 0 + 38. 7 Z         A
                                       f



which  implies  that  the  fission  may  occur  only  for
Z> =    90.  The  fission  products  are  generated  in  an
approximate  way.  The  giant  resonance  effect  is
included  here  as  nuclear  photoabsorbtion.  The
photo-fission  is  activated  by  the  data  record
PFIS.  Secondaries  coming  from  the  interaction  of
the  virtual  photon  with  the  nucleus  will  be  in  the
GEANT  temporary  stack.  If  IPFIS=2  the  secondary
particles  will  not  be  generated  and  the  energy  of
the  photon  will  be  summed  to  DESTEP.  A  table  with
the  photo-fission  cross-sections  as  a  function  of
the  energy  is  put  in  a  bank  at  initialization  time
for  all  the  materials  with  A  bigger  than  230.  See
material  bank  structure  for  details.
