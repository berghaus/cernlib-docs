</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Positioning  a  volume  inside  its
mother  with  parameters</H2>


<PRE>



       CALL  GSPOSP                         (CHNAME,NR,CHMOTH,X,Y,Z,IROT,CHONLY,PAR,NPAR)



Position  a  copy  of  volume  CHNAME  inside  its
mother  CHMOTH  assigning  its  parameters.


CHNAME                         (CHARACTER*4)  name  of  the  volume
                               being  positioned;
NR                             (INTEGER)  copy  number  of  the  volume
                               CHNAME  being  positioned;
CHMOTH                         (CHARACTER*4)  name  of  the  volume  in
                               which  copy  NR  of  CHNAME  is  positioned;
X                              (REAL)  x  position  of  the  volume  in  the
                               mother  reference  system;
Y                              (REAL)  y  position  of  the  volume  in  the
                               mother  reference  system;
Z                              (REAL)  z  position  of  the  volume  in  the
                               mother  reference  system;
IROT                           (INTEGER)  rotation  matrix  number
                               describing  the  orientation  of  the
                               volume  relative  to  the  coordinate
                               system  of  the  mother;
CHONLY                         (CHARACTER*4)  flag  to  indicate
                               whether  a  point  found  to  be  in  this
                               volume  may  also  be  in  other  volumes
                               which  are  not  direct  descendants  of  it
                               --  possible  values  are  ONLY  and  MANY;
PAR                            (REAL)  array  of  parameters  for  the
                               volume  being  positioned;
NPAR                           (INTEGER)  number  of  parameters.


It  is  often  the  case  in  a  detector  to  have  a  family
of  similar  objects,  differing  only  by  their
dimensions.  A  typical  example  are  the  crystals  of
an  electromagnetic  calorimeter.  In  this  case  it
is  convenient  and  logically  consistent  to  give
them  all  the  same  name,  but  assign  to  each  copy  a
different  set  of  parameters.



This  can  be  done  defining  the  volume  with  0
parameters  through  the  routine  GSVOLU  and  then
assigning  the  parameters  to  each  copy  via  the
routine  GSPOSP.


GSPOSP  is  similar  in  all  other  aspects  to  GSPOS
and  the  user  is  referred  to  the  description  of
this  routine  for  more  information.  An  obvious
limitation  is  that  a  volume  defined  with  0
parameters  can  only  be  positioned  via  GSPOSP,
because  otherwise  its  dimensions  will  be
undefined.
