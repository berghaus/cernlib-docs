Description  of  the  routines



       CALL  GSTMED                         (ITMED,NATMED,NMAT,ISVOL,IFIELD,FIELDM,TMAXFD,STEMAX,

This  routine  associates  a  set  of  tracking
parameters  to  a  material,  defining  a  so-called
tracking  medium.  Every  GEANT  volume  must  be
associated  to  an  existing  tracking  medium.  The
routine  stores  the  parameters  of  the  tracking
medium  ITMED  in  the  data  structure  JTMED.

Note:  the  tracking  medium  number  can  in  principle
be  any  positive  integer  from  1  to  65,535.  However
this  number  is  used  directly  by  GEANT  as  the
number  of  the  pointer  to  the  data  structure  where
the  information  is  stored.  When  a  pointer  is
defined,  all  pointers  from  1  to  the  one  allocated
are  created,  if  not  already  existing.  Every  time
data  structures  are  moved  in  memory,  all  the
links  are  potentially  scanned  for  update.  This
can  be  time  consuming  and  it  can  seriously  affect
performances.  So  a  continuous  range  of  numbers
should  be  used  for  tracking  media.

Automatic  calculation  of  the  tracking  parameters


The  results  of  the  simulation  depend  critically
on  the  choice  of  the  tracking  medium  parameters.
To  make  of  GEANT  a  reliable  and  consistent
predictive  tool,  the  calculation  of  these
parameters  has  been  automated.  In  a  normal  GEANT
run,  the  variable  IGAUTO  in  common  /GCTRAK/  is
set  to  1.  In  this  case  the  following  parameters
are  calculated  by  the  program:



                                           o
                                       20                                   if  TMAXFD  < =   0  or  TMAXFD  >20
TMAXFD                  =         -                                                                                                *
 *                    .

                                       input  value                         if  0<  TMAXFD  < =   20



                                                      10
STEMAX                  =                BIG     (= 10      )

 *              0
DEEMAX                  =         -                                                                of  the  material               *
 *                     @

   STMIN                =         -            p  =0====                                                            .

                                       ((5R)/ (   X     ))                      if  ISVOL  6= 0

where  R  is  the  range  in  cm  of  an  electron  of  energy
CUTELE+200keV.


If  the  IGAUTO  variable  is  set  to  0  via  the  AUTO
data  record,  then  value  given  by  the  user  for  the
above  parameters  is  accepted  as  the  true
parameter  value  if  >0,  while  automatic
calculation  still  takes  place  in  case  the  input
value  is  negative.


Users  are  strongly  recommended  to  begin  their
simulation  with  the  parameters  as  calculated  by
GEANT.  Users  who  want  to  modify  any  of  the  above
parameters  must  be  sure  they  understand  their
function  in  the  program  and  the  implications  of  a
change.



The  EPSIL  parameter  represents  the  absolute
precision  with  which  the  tracking  is  performed.
It  has  a  double  meaning.  When  tracking  in
magnetic  field,  EPSIL  is  the  minimum  distance  for
which  boundaries  are  checked.  A  particle  nearer
than  EPSIL  to  the  boundary  is  considered  as
exiting  the  current  volume.  If  the  end  point  of
the  step  of  a  particle  in  magnetic  field  is
distant  less  than  EPSIL  along  each  axis  from  what
would  be  the  end  point  in  absence  of  magnetic
field,  then  no  boundary  checking  is  performed.


In  all  cases,  when  a  particle  is  going  to  reach
the  boundary  of  the  current  volume  with  the
current  step,  the  step  length  is  increased  by  a
quantity  (PREC,  common  /GCTMED/)  which  is  set  to
the  minimum  between  0. 1 x EPSIL           and  10  micron  at
the  beginning  of  the  tracking.  This  quantity  is
recalculated  at  every  step  according  to  the
formula:


PREC        = max     [min      (((EPSIL         )/ (10)), 10mu    ), max     [_x_, _y_, _z_, S)xepsilon             ]
                                                                                                                            (1)
Where  x, y, z  are  the  current  coordinates  of  the
particle,  S  is  the  length  of  the  track,  and
epsilon               is  the  assumed  machine  precision.  epsilon
(called  EPSMAC  in  the  program)  is  initially  set

      -6                                      -11
to  10        for  32  bits  machines  and  10           for  64  bits
machines.  During  the  tracking,  every  fifth  time
that  a  particle  tries  unsuccessfully  to  exit  from
the  same  volume,  the  machine  precision  is
multiplied  by  the  number  of  trials.  This  accounts
for  additional  losses  of  precision  due  to
transformation  of  coordinates  and  region  of  the
floating  point  range  where  the  real  machine
precision  is  different  from  the  above  (this
happens  in  particular  on  IBM  mainframes  with  370
floating  point  number  representation).
