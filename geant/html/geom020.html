</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>`MANY'  Volumes  and  boolean
operations  on  volumes</H2>


<PRE>


The  topology  of  GEANT  is  given  by  16  general
shapes  which  are  used  to  represent  solids  in  the
design  of  detectors.  These  shapes  are  bounded  by
2-nd  order  surfaces  for  reasons  of  speed  at
tracking  time.  New  tools  have  been  introduced  to
extend  the  power  of  the  GEANT  geometry:  boolean
operations  (union,  intersection  and  subtraction)
between  such  shapes  are  now  allowed,  so  that  an
infinity  of  new  shapes  can  be  built;  divisions
along  arbitrary  axis  are  now  possible,  allowing
to  exploit  any  simmetry  in  the  design.  The
tracking  is  now  able  to  handle  overlapping
volumes  in  the  most  general  sense:  the  concept  of
MANY  volumes  has  been  extended  to  automatic
clipping  for  protuding  objects.  Thanks  to  this
MANY  technique,  any  3D  or  2D  geometrical  pattern
can  be  reduced  to  a  single  dimensional  structure,
basically  cancelling  the  need  for  GUNEAR  at
tracking  time.  Finally,  more  than  one  order  of
magnitude  in  speed  has  been  gained  compared  to
the  old  step  search  algorithm  used  to  track  in
MANY  volumes.

<H2>Topological  extensions  via  boolean
operations</H2>


<PRE>


Boolean  operations  between  a  given  set  of  shapes
allow  the  creation  of  an  infinite  number  of
shapes.  Adding  a  single  new  primitive  (for  ex.  a
toroid)  to  the  basic  set  of  shapes,  all  the
possible  combinations  with  all  the  old  shapes



become  moreover  possible.



   *   UNION:  the  union  of  two  volumes  B  and  C  is
       obtained  positioning  two  overlapping  `MANY'
       daughters  B  and  C  inside  the  same  mother  A.  To
       identify  the  result  of  the  union  as  a  single
       volume  is  enough  to  create  a  SET  associated  to
       the  volumes  B  and  C.
   *   SUBTRACTION:  the  subtraction  of  a  volume  B  from
       a  volume  C  is  obtained  positioning  B  as  `ONLY'
       and  C  as  a  `MANY'  overlapping  B.  The  result  of
       the  subtraction  is  automatically  what  the
       tracking  sees  as  the  C  volume,  so  GSPOS  is  the
       only  user  interface  needed.  The  volume  B  can
       have  the  same  material  as  the  mother  A  or  not.
       The  normal  positioning  technique  used  for
       `ONLYs'  is  a  particular  case  of  boolean
       subtraction  (a  volume  is  contained  inside  the
       other).
   *   INTERSECTION:  the  intersection  of  two  volumes
       B  and  C  is  obtained  positioning  a  protuding
       `MANY'  object  C  in  a  `MANY'  object  B  which  is
       normally  placed  in  a  `ONLY'  mother  A.  A  and  B
       must  have  the  same  material,  while  C  has  the
       material  asked  for  the  intersection.  The
       intersection  is  given  by  the  part  of  C  which  is
       not  protuding  from  B,  therefore  by  what  the  new
       tracking  sees  as  the  volume  C:  again  the  only
       needed  user  interface  is  GSPOS.  If  not
       interacting  with  other  daughters  of  A,  B  could
       also  be  `ONLY'.  Without  any  ambiguity,  even
       further  `MANY'  daughters  of  A  can  overlap  the
       protuding  part  of  C  outside  B,  because  it  is
       really  invisible  to  the  new  tracking.

<H2>Divisions  along  arbitrary  axis</H2>


<PRE>


As  protuding  MANY  daughters  are  automatically
clipped  by  their  mother,  it  is  possible  to  divide
objects  along  arbitrary  directions.  Suppose  for
example  that  we  want  to  divide  a  PCON  into  planar
slices  parallel  to  the  plane  X  +  Y  =  0;  it  is
enough  to  position  a  MANY  BOX  embedding
completely  the  PCON  `inside'  the  PCON  itself;  the
BOX  must  be  rotated  of  45  degrees  in  X  and  Y  and
then  divided  along  one  of  its  natural  axis.
Another  example  can  be  the  following:  suppose  we
want  to  divide  24  times  in  PHI  a  PGON  with  only  6
natural  segmentations  in  PHI;  then  we  have  to
position  a  MANY  TUBE,  completely  embedding  the



PGON,  `inside'  the  PGON  itself;  again,  we  can  now
divide  the  tube  in  24  slices  in  PHI  and  the
tracking  will  see  only  the  PGON  divided  24  times
in  PHI.


          Reduction  of  2D  structure  to  1D  structure.


Sometimes  there  are  complicated  multidimensional
geometrical  structures  (like  honeycombs,
spaghetti,  etc.)  which  can  be  reduced  to  the
overlap  of  several  one-dimensional  patterns  (for
which  divisions  can  be  used  or  virtual  divisions
are  particularly  efficient).  The  MANY  option
allows  to  superimpose  such  1D  structures  to
reproduce  the  multi-dimensional  ones  in  a  very
effective  way,  instead  of  positioning  the  volumes
one  by  one  in  the  2D  or  3D  pattern.  The  following
picture  will  explain  better  this  concept.


</PRE>


<H2>Logic  and  algorithm</H2>


<PRE>


In  GTMEDI,  all  the  'MANY'  volumes  for  which  the
point  is  found  inside  (and  not  in  any  of  its
daughters)  is  put  in  a  stack  saving  also  its
branch  of  the  tree.  The  point  is  considered  to  be
in  the  deepest  level  'MANY'.  Each  time  the  point
is  also  found  in  an  intermediate  'ONLY'  volume
the  stack  is  cleared  (to  insure  boolean
subtraction).  In  GTNEXT,  if  stepping  inside  a
'MANY'  volume,  not  ONLY  its  daughters  and  its  own
boundaries  are  checked,  but  also  the  daughters
and  the  boundaries  of  all  the  others  'MANY'  in  the
list  have  to  be  checked.  This  is  not  yet  enough:
the  logic  requires  that  the  boundaries  of  all  the
possible  overlapping  volumes  are  checked,  so  it
is  also  necessary  for  each  `MANY'  volume  of  the
list  to  go  up  to  the  first  'ONLY'  mother  in  the
tree  repeating  the  same  procedure.  This  allows
also  boolean  intersection.  Obviously,  volumes
already  checked  are  not  checked  again.
