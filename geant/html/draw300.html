<H2>The  view  banks</H2>

The  basic  detector  drawing  routines  (GDRAW,
GDRAWC,  GDRAWX)  scan  the  data  structure  JVOLUM
repeatedly  to  extract  position  and  dimension
information  on  the  volumes.  This  can  be  a  rather
lengthy  process  even  on  fast  computer.  Hidden
line  removal  drawing  requires  an  auxiliary  data
structure  and  the  relative  visibility  of  all  the
volumes  has  to  be  analysed.  With  complicated
detectors  the  time  spent  in  this  process  can  be
substantial,  depending  on  the  drawing  options
chosen  and  on  the  speed  of  the  machine  on  which
the  program  is  run.  In  order  to  alleviate  this
problem  the  graphic  banks  and  the  associated
routines  have  been  developed.


The  interpretation  of  the  structure  (for  instance
scanning  of  the  volumes'  data  structure  to
convert  the  3D  geometry  structure  into  a  set  of  2D
lines,  visibility  analysis,  surface  creation  or
light  processing)  is  thus  separate  from  the
drawing  itself.  In  this  way,  the  interpretation
is  performed  only  once  and  all  the  2D  information
is  stored  in  view  banks  (data  structure  JDRAW
[DRAW399]).  These  views  can  then  be  displayed
quickly,  having  only  to  draw  the  2D  vectors  or  the
fill  areas  previously  stored.


For  a  detector  with  more  than  100  different
volumes,  for  example,  this  costs  only  a  few
thousand  words  of  memory  for  each  drawing  stored.


If  the  drawing  routines  are  called  while  a  view
bank,  identified  by  a  positive  integer,  is  open
(GDOPEN)  only  interpretation  will  be  made,  no
output  will  be  generated  until  the  bank  is  closed
(GDCLOS).  When  a  view  bank  has  been  closed  it
cannot  be  modified,  but  it  can  be  displayed  as
many  times  as  wanted  (GDSHOW)  or  deleted



(GDELET).


Once  a  drawing  (detectors,  tracks  or  hits)  is  in  a
view  bank,  it  is  possible  to  scan  it  in  detail  via
the  LENS  or  ZOOM  interactive  commands  (only
available  with  X11).  For  more  information  see  the
[XINT]  section.



       CALL  GDOPEN                         (IVIEW)



IVIEW                     (INTEGER)  view  bank  number  (IVIEW>0).


Opens  a  view  bank,  used  to  store  2D  graphics
information  coming  from  the  interpretation  of  3D
structures  (but  also  2D  annotation).  All
subsequent  calls  to  the  drawing  routines  will
fill  the  view  bank  IVIEW,  without  generating  any
output.



       CALL  GDCLOS



Closes  the  current  opened  view  bank.  Once  a  view
bank  has  been  closed  no  more  drawing  can  be  added
to  it.  A  call  to  GDCLOS  also  restores  the  screen.



       CALL  GDSHOW                         (IVIEW)



IVIEW                     (INTEGER)  view  bank  number  (IVIEW>0).


Displays  view  bank  IVIEW.  GDSHOW  can  be  called
either  before  or  after  a  view  bank  has  been
closed.  If  a  view  bank  is  currently  open,  the
content  of  bank  IVIEW  will  be  added  to  it.

       CALL  GDELET                         (IVIEW)



IVIEW                     (INTEGER)  view  bank  number  (IVIEW>0).


Deletes  a  view  bank  from  memory.  If  called  before
a  bank  has  been  closed,  GDELET  will  also  restore
the  screen  mode.


Note:  the  JDRAW  data  structure  has  a  top  level
bank  which  contains  one  word  for  each  view  bank  in
Q(JDRAW+IVIEW).  This  word  is  a  key  which
determines  the  status  of  the  bank.  If  this  key  is
3,  the  bank  itself  is  protected  against  deletion,
and  it  cannot  be  deleted  by  GDELET.  An  example  of
use  of  view  banks  is  shown  in  Fig.  ??    .
