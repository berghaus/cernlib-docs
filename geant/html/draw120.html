       CALL  GDRAWX                         (CHNAME,CUTTHE,CUTPHI,CUTVAL,THETA,PHI,U0,V0,SU,SV)



CHNAME                    (CHARECTER*4)  name  of  volume;
CUTTHE                    (REAL)  theta           angle  of  the  line  normal  to
                          the  cut  plane;
CUTPHI                    (REAL)  phi       angle  of  the  line  normal  to
                          the  cut  plane;
TETHA                     (REAL)  viewing  angle  theta         ;
PHI                       (REAL)  viewing  angle  phi     ;
U0                        (REAL)  u  coordinate  on  the  screen  of  the
                          volume  origin;
V0                        (REAL)  v  coordinate  on  the  screen  of  the
                          volume  origin;
SU                        (REAL)  scale  factor  for  u  coordinates;
SV                        (REAL)  scale  factor  for  v  coordinates.


Draws  a  cut  view  of  the  volume  CHNAME  with  all  its
visible  descendants,  i.e.  draws  their
intersection  with  the  cut  plane  normal  to  the
axis  given  by  the  angles  CUTTHE,  CUTPHI  at  the
distance  CUTVAL  from  the  origin.  The  view  point
is  defined  by  the  angles  THETA,  PHI.  U0,  V0,  SU,
SV  have  the  same  meaning  as  in  GDRAW.  These  view
parameters,  as  well  as  zoom  parameters  set  by
GDZOOM  are  copied  in  /GCDRAW/.


Attributes  like  colour,  surface  fill,  line  width,
line  style,  visibility,  etc.  can  be  set  by  the
GSATT  routine  for  CHNAME  and  its  descendants
[GEOM500].



       CALL  GDRAWC                         (CHNAME,IAX,CUTVAL,U0,V0,SU,SV)



CHNAME                    (CHARECTER*4)  name  of  volume;
IAX                       (INTEGER)  axis  of  the  cut  (1=X,  2=Y,
                          3=Z);



U0                        (REAL)  u  coordinate  on  the  screen  of  the
                          volume  origin;
V0                        (REAL)  v  coordinate  on  the  screen  of  the
                          volume  origin;
SU                        (REAL)  scale  factor  for  u  coordinates;
SV                        (REAL)  scale  factor  for  v  coordinates.


This  routine  is  a  special  case  of  the  previous
GDRAWX.  Here  the  cut  plane  is  normal  to  one  of  the
main  axes  (IAX)  and  placed  at  a  distance  CUTVAL
from  the  origin.  The  view-point  is  along  the  same
axis.


Fig.  ??     gives  an  example  of  utilisation  of
GDAXIS,  GDRAW  and  GDRAWX.  Fig.  ??     gives  an
example  of  use  of  GDRAWC.
