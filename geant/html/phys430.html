       CALL  GDRELA



GDRELA  initialises  the  ionisation  energy-loss
tables  for  different  materials  and  particles.  The
energy  binning  is  in  the  array  ELOW  (/GCMULO/)
initialised  in  the  routine  GPHYSI.  The  tables  are

                                                -1
filled  with  the  quantity  dE/ dx  in  GeV  cm      ,  for
elements,  mixtures  and  compounds.  A  temporary
table  is  also  filled,  containing  additional
points  for  integration,  to  obtain  the
range-energy  table  (see  [PHYS010]).


GDRELP  computes  the  ionisation  energy  loss  for
protons,  and  the  values  are  stored  in  the  energy
loss  table.  This  value  is  used  for  other  charged
hadrons  with  scaled  energy  bin.


GDRELM  computes  the  ionisation  energy  loss  for
muons,  and  sums  it  in  the  muon  table  with  the
energy  loss  due  to  the  other  processes
(bremsstrahlung,  pair  production  and  nuclear
interactions).


The  following  pointers  are  used:



                                                       th

JEL1  =  LQ(JMA-1)                                    dE/ dx  for  e+/e-(see

JEL3  =  LQ(JMA-3)                                    dE/ dx  for  protons  (used  also
                                                      for  other  charged  particles).

This  routine  calculates  the  ionisation  energy
loss  for  a  muon  or  a  proton.  It  is  called  by  GDRELM
and  GDRELP.

CDRSGA  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for  the
production  of  delta         -rays  by  electrons  (M"oller



scattering),  positrons  (Bhabha  scattering)  and
muons.  For  hadrons,  this  value  is  calculated  at
tracking  time.  The  mean  free  path  as  a  function  of

<H2>Method</H2>

In  GEANT,  delta         -rays  are  generated  only  above  a
threshold  energy  T           which  corresponds  to  the
                    cut

variable  DCUTE  for  electrons  and  positrons,  DCUTM
for  all  other  charged  particles.  The  total
cross-section  for  the  production  of  a  delta         -ray
electron  of  kinetic  energy  T>T          =DCUTE,  DCUTM
                                  cut

by  a  particle  of  kinetic  energy  E  is:


                                      T

   sigma         (E, T         ) = R   max        ((dsigma         (E, T))/ (dT))dT                                         (1)
                      cut

                                      T
                                       cut


where  T           is  the  maximum  energy  transferable  to
        max

the  free  electron:


                                2                                                  2
T          = ((2m(gamma            - 1))/ (1+2gamma         ((m)/ (M))+(((m)/ (M)))   ))
 max

                                                                                                                            (2)


The  energy  lost  in  ionising  collisions  producing
delta         -rays  below  T            are  included  in  the
                             cut

continuous  energy  loss.  The  mean  value  of  the



energy  lost  due  to  these  soft  collisions  is:


                                       T

     E            (E, T         ) = R   cut        T((dsigma         (E, T))/ (dT))dT
      loss             cut

                                       0

                                                                                                                            (3)
where  m  is  the  electron  mass  and  M  is  the  mass  of
the  incident  particle.


In  this  chapter,  the  method  of  calculation  of  the
continuous  energy  loss  and  the  total
cross-section  are  explained.  The  generation  of
delta         -rays  is  explained  in  chapter  [PHYS331].

and  I  is  the  average  ionisation  potential  of  the
atom  in  question.  There  exists  a  variety  of
phenomenological  approximations  for  this.  In
former  versions  of  GEANT  the  formula  quoted  by

                    0.9
was  used  (I = 16 Z           eV).  At  present  the  values
recommended  by    are  used.  The  ionisation



potential  I  only  enters  into  the  logarithmic  term
of  the  energy  loss  formula,  but  it  has  been
verified  that  the  new  parameterisation  gives
better  accuracy  especially  in  the  case  of  high  Z.
It  should  be  noted  that  this  is  not  the  value  of  I
which  is  stored  in  the  material  data  structure  by

                                                   0.9
GPROBI,  which  is  still  calculated  as  I = 16 Z
eV.


Note:  the  ionisation  potential  I  must  not  be
changed  blindly,  hoping  that  the  most  up-to-date
values  give  the  better  results.  The  value  of  I  is
closely  connected  to  the  shell  correction  term
(see  later).


delta           is  a  correction  term  which  takes  account  of
the  reduction  in  energy  loss  due  to  the  so-called
density  effect.  This  becomes  important  at  high
energy  because  media  have  a  tendency  to  become
polarised  as  the  incident  particle  velocity
increases.  As  a  consequence,  the  atoms  in  a
medium  can  no  longer  be  considered  as  isolated.
To  correct  for  this  effect  the  formulation  of
Sternheimer    is  used:

C   / Z  is  a  so-called  shell  correction  term  which
 e

accounts  for  the  fact  that,  at  low  energies  for
light  elements  and  at  all  energies  for  heavy
ones,  the  probability  of  collision  with  the
electrons  of  the  inner  atomic  shells  (K,  L,  etc.)
is  negligible.  The  semi-empirical  formula  used  in
GEANT,  applicable  to  all  materials,  is  due  to



Barkas  :

C     is  a  dimensionless  constant,  but  as  I  in  the

down  at  low  energies,  and  it  only  applies  for
values  of  eta     >0. 13  (i.e.  T>7. 9  MeV  for  a  proton).
For  eta     < =    0. 13  the  shell  correction  term  is

logarithmically  from  T = 7. 9  MeV  to  T = T       = 2  MeV.

GDRELX  has  been  tested  for  protons  against  energy
loss  tables    for  various  materials  in  the  energy
range  50  MeV-25  GeV.  Typical  discrepancies  are  as
follows:



    Beryllium:                         1.1%  at  0.05  GeV                              0.02%  at  25  GeV



    Hydrogen  :                        1.5%  at  0.05  GeV                              12.1%  at  25  GeV



    Water  :                           8.1%  at  0.05  GeV                              4.4%  at  6  GeV



The  mean  energy  loss  can  be  described  by  the
Bethe-Bloch  formula  (??    )  only  if  the  projectile
velocity  is  larger  than  that  of  orbital
electrons.  In  the  low-energy  region  where  this  is
not  verified,  a  different  kind  of



parameterisation  has  been  chosen  :

Table  0.2:  Test  of  GDRELP  against  stopping  power
tables.  Stated  accuracy  of  the  tables  is        5%  for
T>0. 5  MeV  and   10%  for  T<0. 5  MeV



and  energy  loss  tables.  Some  of  the  test  results
are  summarised  in  tables  ??    ,  ??     and  ??    .


The  energy  lost  due  to  the  soft  delta         -rays  is
tabulated  during  initialisation  as  a  function  of
the  medium  and  of  the  energy  by  routine  GDRELA


The  tables  are  filled  with  the  quantity  dE/ dx  in

       -1
GeV  cm        (formula  (??    )  above).  For  a  molecule  or  a
mixture  the  following  formula  is  used:

           ((dE)/ (dx)) = rho      sum        p   (((dE)/ (dX)))                                                            (6)
                                       i       i                i



                                   -2
where  x  is  in  cm,  X  in  g  cm        and  p     is  the
                                                 i

                                  th
proportion  by  weight  of  the  I        element.


The  energy  loss  of  all  charged  particles  other
than  electrons,  positrons  and  muons  is  obtained
from  that  of  protons  by  calculating  the  kinetic
energy  of  a  proton  with  the  same  beta       ,  and  using
this  value  to  interpolate  the  tables:

                                      T                  = ((M   )/ (M))T                                                   (7)

The  mean  free  path  is  tabulated  during
initialisation  as  a  function  of  the  medium  and  of
the  energy  by  the  routine  GDRSGA  for  leptons
only.


The  cross-section  (??    )  is  strongly  dependent  on
the  mass  of  the  incident  particle,  and  cannot  be
tabulated  in  a  general  way  for  any  charged
hadrons.  Therefore,  for  such  particles,  the
cross-section  is  computed  at  tracking  time  in  the
routine  GTHADR.
