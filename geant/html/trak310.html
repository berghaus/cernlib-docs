</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Altering  the  order  of  tracking
secondary  particles</H2>


<PRE>


When  secondary  particles  are  produced  during
particle  transport,  if  the  user  wants  to
transport  them  in  turn,  they  must  be  stored  by  a
call  to  GSKING  or  GSKPHO  onto  the  temporary  stack
JSTAK.  As  explained  in  [TRAK310],  this  is  a  LIFO
structure,  where  the  last  particle  introduced  is
the  first  to  be  extracted  to  be  transported.  It
may  be  sometimes  interesting  to  alter  the  order
of  tracking,  for  instance  to  decide  whether  the
current  event  is  worth  completing  or  whether  it
should  be  skipped  to  go  to  next  one.


It  is  possible  in  GEANT  to  alter  the  behaviour  of
the  JSTAK  structure  using  one  of  the  words  of  the
stack,  normally  reserved  for  the  user.  Stack
ordering  is  activated  via  the  data  record  SORD  1.
This  will  set  to  1  the  variable  ISTORD  in  common
/GCSTAK/,  which  is  by  default  initialised  to  0.


When  stack  ordering  is  activated,  the  routine
GLTRAC,  which  fetches  the  next  particle  to  be
tracked  from  JSTAK,  instead  of  the  last  one,  will
select  the  one  with  the  maximum  value  of  the  user
word.  This  user  word  must  be  set  by  the  user  in  the
variable  UPWGHT  in  the  common  /GCTRAK/  prior  to
the  call  to  GSKING  to  store  each  secondary.


If,  for  instance,  all  the  protons  must  be  tracked
first,  in  order  of  production,  and  all  the  other
particles  after,  again  according  to  their  time  of
production,  the  following  code  should  appear  in
GUSTEP:
           SUBROUTINE  GUSTEP
+SEQ,GCTRAK,GCKING
           .
           .
           .
           DO  10  IG=1,NGKINE
*---                Younger  particles  tracked  first
*---                Add  to  the  current  time  of  flight  the  time  delay  of
*---                the  secondary
                UPWGHT  =  -TOFG-TOFD(IG)
                IPART  =  GKIN(5,IG)



                IF(IPART.EQ.14)  THEN
*---                This  is  a  proton,  add  a  100  microseconds  to  have  it
*---                tracked  first
                      UPWGHT  =  UPWGHT+1E-4
                ENDIF
*---                Now  store  the  particle  in  the  GEANT  stack
                CALL  GSKING(IG)
    10    CONTINUE


Users  should  be  aware  of  the  fact  that  ordering
the  stack  will  change  the  results,  because
transport  depends  on  random  numbers  which  will  be
different  for  the  same  particle  in  the  two  cases.
