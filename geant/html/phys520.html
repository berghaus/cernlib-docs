       CALL  FLINIT



FLINIT  initialises  the  FLUKA  variables  and  reads
data  from  a  file  (flukaaf.dat)  which  is
automatically  opened.  FLINIT  is  called  from
FLDIST  when  a  hadron  enters  there  first  time  in
the  run.



       CALL  FLDIST



FLDIST  computes  the  distance  to  the  next
interaction  point.  It  calls  the  FLUKA  routines  to
compute  the  cross-sections  for  all  particles
except  neutrons  with  kinetic  energy  below  20  MeV
for  which  GHEISHA  routines  are  called.  FLDIST  is
called  from  the  user  routine  GUPHAD  where  the
hadronic  package  can  be  chosen.



       CALL  FLUFIN



FLUFIN  calls  the  FLUKA  routines  to  generate  the
hadronic  interaction.  It  passes  the  particle  to
FLUKA  interaction  routines  and  puts  the  eventual
secondary  particles  to  the  GEANT  stack.  FLUFIN  is
called  from  the  user  routine  GUHADR.

<H2>Method</H2>


<PRE>


FLUKA    is  a  simulation  program  which  as  a
standalone  code  contains  transport  and  the
physical  processes  for  hadrons  and  leptons  and
tools  for  geometrical  description.  In  GEANT,  only
the  hadronic  interaction  part  is  included.


The  total  cross-section  of  the  hadronic  processes
is  computed  by  FLUKA  routines  called  from  FLDIST
(the  cross-section  for  neutrons  below  20  MeV  is
computed  in  GHEISHA).  If  hadronic  intercation  is
chosen  in  GEANT  tracking  routine,  the  particle  is
passed  to  FLUFIN.


If  particles  are  stopping  (i.e.  their  energy  is
below  the  cut-off  energy),  their  kinetic  energy
is  deposited.  However,  if  the  particle  can  decay

       +
(pi       ,  K   )  it  is  forced  to  decay,  or  if  it  is  an

                               -
annihilating  particle  (pi       ,  n  ,  p  ),  it  is  sent  to
FLUKA  routines  for  annihilation.  The  neutrons
with  kinetic  energy  below  20  MeV  are  passed  to
GHEISHA.


If  the  particle  is  not  stopping,  a  sampling  is
done  between  elastic  and  inelastic  processes.  The
cross-sections  have  been  computed  in  FLDIST  in
the  same  time  as  the  total  cross-section.  The
particle  is  sent  correspondingly  to  the  elastic
or  inelastic  interaction  routines.  After  the
interaction,  the  eventual  secondary  particles
are  written  to  GEANT  stack.  The  program  flow  is
shown  in  figures  ??     and  ??    .


When  the  tracking  media  is  a  mixture  or  a  compound
material  (defined  by  GSMIXT,  see  [CONS110]),  the
atom  with  which  the  interaction  is  taking  place
is  chosen  by  sampling  on  the  basis  of  the
cross-sections.  This  is  important  especially  in
hydrogenous  materials.
