<H2>Introduction</H2>


<PRE>


In  the  context  of  GEANT:


   *   hit  is  the  user-defined  information  recorded
       at  tracking  time  to  keep  track  of  the
       interaction  between  one  particle  and  a  given
       detector,  and  necessary  to  compute  the
       digitisations  later.
   *   digitisation  (digit)  is  the  user-defined
       information  simulating  the  response  of  a  given
       detector  element,  usually  estimated  after
       tracking  a  complete  event.


The  detector  response  package  consists  of  tools
to  store,  retrieve  or  print  the  information
relevant  to  hits  and  digitisation  which  is  in  the
data  structures  JSET,  JHITS  and  JDIGI.  A  few
subroutines  which  may  help  the  user  to  solve  some
of  the  usual  digitisation  problems  in  simple
detectors  have  been  added  to  the  package,  e.g.
the  intersection  of  a  track  with  a  plane  or  a
cylinder  and  the  digitisation  of  conventional
drift  and  MWP  chambers.


For  complex  setups  with  different  types  of
detectors  the  user  has  normally  to  define  several
types  of  hits  and  digitisations.  In  addition  to
the  hits  generated  by  all  particles  of  the
current  event,  computing  the  digitisations
requires  usually  some  information  about  the
intrinsic  characteristics  and  performance  of  the
detectors.  The  information  to  be  recorded  for  the
hits  and  digitisations  is  highly  experiment
dependent,  therefore  only  a  framework  can  be
proposed  to  store  it.


Two  remarks  can  be  made:



   *   during  the  life  of  an  experiment,  the  stability
       of  the  format  and  content  of  the  information  to
       be  stored  is  usually  reached  much  earlier  for
       the  hits  than  for  the  digitisations.  Therefore
       the  user  may  save  computing  time  by  designing
       an  intermediate  event  output  at  the  hits  level.
   *   the  scheme  proposed  for  storing  the
       digitisations  should  in  any  case  be  considered
       as  an  intermediate  stage,  a  further  processing
       of  the  data  being  necessary  if  the  user  wants
       to  simulate  more  closely  the  specific  format  of
       the  real  data-acquisition  system.

<H2>SETs  and  DETectors</H2>


<PRE>


The  reader  is  assumed  to  be  familiar  with  the  way
the  geometrical  setup  is  described  ([GEOM]),  in
particular  with  the  concepts  of  logical  and
physical  volume  tree  structure.


The  user  is  required  to  classify  into  sets  all
sensitive  detectors  (defined  as  those  volume
defined  as  detector  via  GSDET/GSDETV)  for  which
he  wants  to  store  hits  in  the  data  structure
JHITS.  The  4-character  names  which  identify  the
sets  are  user  defined,  and  the  list  of  sets  which
the  user  wants  to  activate  for  a  given  run  can  be
entered  through  the  data  record  SETS.  The  user
can  group  together  in  one  or  in  several  sets
detectors  of  the  same  or  different  types.  For
convenience,  it  is  recommended  to  have  at  least
one  set  for  each  main  component  of  the  setup,  e.g.
hadronic  calorimeters,  electromagnetic
calorimeters,  vertex  chamber,  etc.


A  volume  can  be  declared  as  a  sensitive  detector
through  the  tracking  medium  parameter  ISVOL,  and
allocated  to  a  set  through  the  subroutine  GSDET
or  GSDETV.  Each  (logical)  sensitive  detector  is
identified  by  the  4-character  name  of  the
corresponding  volume.  As  a  given  volume  may
describe  several  similar  detectors  in  the
physical  setup,  some  additional  information  is
needed  for  associating  correctly  the  hits  with
the  physical  detectors.


When  using  GSDET  the  user  has  to  enter  the
(shortest)  list  of  volume  names  (the  vector
CHNMSV),  which  permits  unambiguous
identification  of  the  path  through  the  physical
tree,  even  in  the  presence  of  multiple  copies.
This  identification  is  obtained  by  specifying  a



list  of  volume  numbers  (the  vector  NUMBV),  in  a
one  to  one  correspondence  with  the  list  of  volume
names.  This  list,  after  packing,  will  constitute
the  identifier  of  the  physical  detector.


If  GSDETV  is  used  instead  of  GSDET  then  the
routine  GGDETV  (called  by  GGCLOS)  constructs  the
lists  CHNMSV  automatically  and  stores  them  in  the
structure  JSET.


</PRE>


<H2>The  user  tools</H2>


<PRE>


The  data  structure  JSET  is  built  through  calls  to
the  routine  GSDET  or  GSDETV  which  assign
detectors  to  sets  and  define  their  parameters.
After  this,  the  following  routines  can  be  called,
for  each  detector,  to  complete  the  structure:


GSDETH                    provides  the  parameters  required  for
                          the  storage  of  the  hit  elements  in  the
                          data  structure  JHITS,  such  as  the
                          packing  and  scaling  conventions;
GSDETD                    provides  the  parameters  required  for
                          the  storage  of  the  digitisations  in  the
                          structure  JDIGI,  such  as  the  packing
                          conventions;
GSDETU                    adds  the  user  parameters,  which  may
                          consist,  for  instance,  of  the  intrinsic
                          detector  characteristics  needed  for
                          computing  the  digitisations.


To  permit  storage  of  more  than  one  type  of  hit  for
a  given  sensitive  detector,  or  to  provide
additional  detector  entries,  detector  aliases
can  be  defined  through  calls  to  the  routine
GSDETA.  They  are  entered  in  the  JSET  structure  as
new  detectors,  with  the  same  geometrical
characteristics  as  the  original  one.  The  user  has
the  possibility  to  call  appropriate  routines
GSDETH,  GSDETD  and  GSDETU  for  this  new  detector.


During  the  tracking,  for  each  step  inside  the
sensitive  detectors,  under  control  of  the
subroutine  GUSTEP,  the  hits  can  be  stored  in  the
data  structure  JHITS  through  the  subroutine
GSAHIT  (or  GSCHIT,  more  appropriate  for
calorimetry).  For  each  hit  the  information
consists  of:


   *   the  reference  to  the  track  in  the  structure
       JKINE;



   *   the  packed  identifier  of  the  physical
       detector;
   *   the  packed  data  for  the  different  elements  of
       the  hit.


When  the  tracking  has  been  completed  for  the
whole  event  the  digitisations  can  be  computed  in
the  user  subroutine  GUDIGI  which  may  extract  the
hits  with  the  subroutine  GFHITS  and  store  the
digitisations  in  the  data  structure  JDIGI,  with
the  subroutine  GSDIGI.  For  each  digitisation  the
information  should  at  least  consist  of:


   *   the  reference  to  the  track(s);
   *   the  packed  identifier  of  the  physical
       detector;
   *   the  packed  data  for  the  digitisation  itself.

<H2>Retrieval  of  geometrical  information</H2>


<PRE>


The  packed  identifier  of  a  physical  detector,
stored  as  part  of  the  hit  (or  digitisation)
information,  is  returned  unpacked  by  the  routine
GFHITS  (or  GFDIGI)  which  extracts  the  information
from  the  JHITS  or  JDIGI  structures,  and  may  be
used  to  retrieve  the  geometrical  characteristics
of  the  given  detector.


If  the  detectors  have  been  defined  by  the  routine
GSDETV,  the  geometrical  information  can  be
retrieved  by  the  routines  GFPATH  and  GLVOLU.
GFPATH  prepares  the  lists  CHNAM  and  LNUM  required
by  GLVOLU  ([GEOM001]),  from  the  information
preprocessed  at  initialisation  time  by  the
routine  GGDETV  and  stored  in  the  structure  JSET
