       CALL  GBREME



GBREME  generates  a  bremsstrahlung  photon  from  an
electron  as  a  discrete  process.  The  photon  energy
is  sampled  from  a  parameterisation  of  the
bremsstrahlung  cross-section  of  Seltzer  and
Berger    for  electron  energies  below  10  GeV,  and
from  the  screened  Bethe-Heitler  cross-section
above  10  GeV.  Midgal  corrections  are  applied  in
both  cases.  The  angular  distribution  of  the
photon  is  calculated  by  the  function  GBTETH.



    Input  :                   via  common  block  /GCTRAK/



    Output:                    via  common  block  /GCKING/.



GBREME  is  called  from  the  tracking  routine  GTELEC
when  the  parent  electron  reaches  a  radiation
point  during  tracking.

The  photon  energy  is  sampled  according  to  the
Seltzer  and  Berger  bremsstrahlung  spectrum  .
Seltzer  and  Berger  have  calculated  the  spectra
for  materials  with  atomic  numbers  Z  =
6,13,29,47,74,92  in  the  electron  (kinetic)
energy  range  1  keV  -  10  GeV.  Their  tabulated
results  have  been  used  as  input  in  a
parametrising-fitting  procedure.  The  functional
form  of  the  parameterisation  for  the  quantity:



                                  S(x) = Ck((dsigma         )/ (dk))

 The  `high  energy'  (T  >  1  MeV)  formula  comes  from
 the  Coulomb-corrected,  sceened  Bethe-Heitler
 formula  (see  e.g.  ).  However,  there  are  two
 things  in  eq.  (??    )  which  make  a  difference:


1.      a   , b     depend  on  T  and  on  the  atomic  number  Z  (
         h     h

        in  the  case  of  the  Bethe-Heitler  spectrum
        a    = 1,  b    = 0. 75);
         h          h

2.      the  function  F  is  not  the  same  than  that  in  the
        Bethe-Heitler  cross-section,  this  function
        gives  a  better  behaviour  in  the  high  frequency
        limit,  i.e.  when  k- >   T  (x- >   1).


 The  T  and  Z  dependence  of  the  parameters  are
 described  by  the  equations:



                                                                   2                     3
       a            =         1 + ((a      )/ (u)) + ((a      )/ (u   )) + ((a      )/ (u   ))

                                                                       2                     3
       b            =         0. 75 + ((b      )/ (u)) + ((b      )/ (u   )) + ((b      )/ (u   ))

 the  a      , b      , a      , b        parameters  are  polynomials
       hi       hi       li       li

 of  second  order  in  the  variable:



                                                             1/3
                                               v = [Z(Z + 1)]



 It  can  be  seen  relatively  easily  that  for  the
 limiting  case  T- >   1,  a   - >   1, b   - >   0. 75,  so  eq.  (??    )
                             h            h

 gives  the  Bethe-Heitler  cross  section.


 There  are  altogether  36  linear  parameter  in  the
 formulae  ,  their  values  are  given  in  GBREME.  The
 parameterisation  reproduces  the  Seltzer-Berger
 tables  within  a  few  %  (2-3  %  on  average,  the
 maximum  error  being  less  than  10-12  %),  the
 tables,  on  the  other  hand,  agree  well  with  the
 experimental  data  and  theoretical  (low-  and
 high-energy)  results  (less  than  10  %  below  50
 MeV,  less  than  5  %  above  50  MeV).


 Apart  from  the  normalisation  the  cross  section
 differential  in  photon  energy  can  be  written  as:

 ((dsigma         )/ (dk)) = ((1)/ (ln    ((1)/ (x   ))))((1)/ (x))g(x) = ((1)/ (ln    ((1)/ (x   ))))((1)/ (x))((S(x))/ (S        *
 * ))
                                                  c                                            c                           max



 where  x    = k   / T,  k     is  the  photon  cut-off  energy
         c      c         c

 below  which  the  bremsstrahlung  is  treated  as  a
 continuous  energy  loss  (this  cut  is  BCUTE  in  the
 program).  Using  this  decomposition  of  the  cross
 section  and  two  random  numbers  r   ,  r     uniformly
                                      1      2

 distributed  in  ]0, 1[,  the  sampling  of  x  is  done  as
 follows:


1.      sample  x  from


                                                                                                     r    ln    x
        ((1)/ (ln    ((1)/ (x   ))))((1)/ (x))               setting                            x = e 1          c
                             c



2.      calculate  the  rejection  function  g(x)  and:
                  *    if  r   >g(x)  reject  x  and  go  back  to  1;
                            2

                  *    if  r   < =    g(x)  accept  x.
                            2


 To  apply  the  Migdal  correction    all  it  has  to  be
 done  is  to  multiply  the  rejection  function  by  the
 Migdal  correction  factor:



                                                             2                                   2
 C   (epsilon             ) = ((1 + C   / epsilon               )/ (1 + C   / epsilon               ))
  M                                  0                                   0
                                                             c


 where


                                 2
 C    = ((nr   lambda         -     )/ (pi    )),                epsilon                = ((k   )/ (E))
  0         0                                                                        c       c

          electron.


 This  correction  decreases  the  cross-section  for
 low  photon  energy.


 After  the  successful  sampling  of  epsilon             ,  GBREME
 generates  the  polar  angles  of  the  radiated  photon
 with  respect  to  the  parent  electron's  momentum.
 It  is  difficult  to  find  in  the  literature  simple
 formulas  for  this  angle.  For  example  the  double
 differential  cross  section  reported  by  Tsai    is
 the  following:


                                                                                               2   2              4                *

 This  distribution  is  complicated  to  sample,  and
 it  is  anyway  only  an  approximation  to  within  few
 percent,  if  nothing  else,  due  to  the  presence  of
 the  atomic  form-factors.  The  angular  dependence

                                                       -1
 is  contained  in  the  variable  u = Etheta         m      .  For  a
 given  value  of  u  the  dependence  of  the  shape  of
 the  function  on  Z,  E,  epsilon             = k/ E  is  very  weak.
 Thus,  the  distribution  can  be  approximated  by  a
 function

                                               -au            -3au
                                    f(u) = C(ue          + due            )                                                  (2)

 C = ((9a   )/ (9+d))               a = 0. 625               d = 0. 13(0. 8+((1. 3)/ (Z)))(100+((1)/ (E)))(1+epsilon             )

 where  E  is  in  GeV.  While  this  approximation  is
 good  at  high  energies,  it  becomes  less  accurate
 around  few  MeV.  However  in  that  region  the
 ionisation  losses  dominate  over  the  radiative
 losses.


 The  sampling  of  the  function  f(u)  can  be  done  in
 the  following  way  (r   , i = 1, 2, 3  are  uniformly
                        i

 distributed  random  numbers  in  [0,1]):

1.      Choose  between  ue           and  due            :



                                        a            if           r   <9/ (9 + d)

                               b = -                               1                                   .

                                        3a           if           r   > =    9/ (9 + d)

                                         u =- ((log       (r   r   ))/ (b))

        otherwise  go  back  to  1.


 The  probability  of  failing  in  the  last  test  is
 reported  in  table  ??    .


 The  function  f(u)  can  be  used  also  to  describe  the
 angular  distribution  of  the  photon  in  mu
 bremsstrahlung  and  to  describe  the  angular
 distribution  in  photon  pair  production.


 The  azimuthal  angle,  Phi     ,  is  generated
 isotropically.  This  information  is  used  to
 calculate  the  momentum  vector  of  the  radiated
 photon,  to  transform  it  to  the  GEANT  coordinate
 system  and  to  store  the  result  into  common  block
 /GCKING/.  Also,  the  momentum  of  the  parent
 electron  is  updated.
