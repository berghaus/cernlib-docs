DIN                       (REAL)  array  of  dimension  3  containing
                          the  direction  of  the  scattered  particle
                          with  respect  to  the  incoming  direction;


Generates  single  scatters  in  small  angle
approximation  returning  the  new  direction  with

In  the  Moliere  theory  the  average  number  of
Coulomb  scatters  for  a  charged  particle  in  a  step
is  expressed  by  the  parameter  Omega              (see
                                                 0

[PHYS325]).  When  Omega            < =    20,  the  Moliere  theory
                                 0

is  not  applicable  any  more,  even  if  it  has  been
noted    that  it  still  gives  reasonable  results
down  to  its  mathematical  limit  Omega             = e.  The
                                                  0

range  1<Omega            < =    20  is  called  the  plural
                       0

scattering  regime.  An  interesting  study  of  this



regime  can  be  found  in  .


In  GEANT,  when  Omega            < =    20,  a  direct  simulation
                                0

method  is  used  for  the  scattering  angle.  The
number  of  scatters  is  distributed  according  to  a
Poissonian  law  with  average

                                       2gamma         -1
Omega          = kOmega             = e                       Omega             ss 1. 167Omega

the  customary  notations  for  the  probability
distribution  function  for  small  angle
(sin      theta          ss theta         )  single  scattering,  we  can
write:



f(theta         )theta         dtheta          = ((dsigma         )/ (theta         dtheta         ))((1)/ (sigma         ))theta  *

where  sigma           is  the  cross  section  for  single
elastic  scattering.  We  use  as  cross  section  the
one  reported  by  Moliere    :

This  is  the  classical  Rutherford  cross  section
corrected  by  the  screening  angle  chi                    .  This
                                              alpha

angle  is  described  by  Moliere  as  a  correction  to
the  Born  approximation  used  to  derive  the  quantum
mechanical  form  of  the  Rutherford  cross  section.
We  have  then:

sample  from  this  distribution  we  calculate  the
inverse  of  the  distribution  function:

where  eta       is  a  number  uniformly  distributed
between  0  and  1.  If  we  observe  that  also  1- eta       is
uniformly  distributed  between  0  and  1  and  we
remember  the  definition  of  Theta         ,  we  obtain:
