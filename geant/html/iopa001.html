</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>The  I/O  routines</H2>


<PRE>    The  I/O  routines  allow  one  to  read,  write
or  print  the  GEANT  data  structures.  All  GEANT  I/O
is  handled  though  the  ZEBRA  system,  which
provides  the  following  facilities:


   *   native  and  machine  independent  I/O  to  and  from
       disk  and  tape  devices;
   *   sequential  and  direct  access  I/O  (from  disk);


This  allows,  for  example,  to  generate  events  on
one  machine,  dump  the  data  structures  to  a  mass
storage  device,  and  then  read  them  back  for
further  processing  on  a  different  machine.


This  section  describes  the  various  routines  for
I/O  in  GEANT.  For  a  complete  reference  on  the
ZEBRA  I/O  system  the  user  is  referred  to  the  ZEBRA
documentation  .
