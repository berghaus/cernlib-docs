       CALL  GLOOK                       (CHNAME,IVECT,N,ILOOK*)



CHNAME                    (CHARACTER*4)  variable  containing  the
                          name  to  be  searched  for  in  IVECT;
IVECT                     (INTEGER)  array  containing  the  ASCII
                          code  of  the  names  among  which  NAME  is
                          searched.  The  names  are  stored  4
                          characters  per  word;
N                         (INTEGER)  number  of  items  in  IVECT;
ILOOK                     (INTEGER)  position  in  IVECT  where  NAME
                          has  been  found,  0  if  not  found.


This  routine  is  very  useful  when  searching  for  a
string  stored  in  a  ZEBRA  bank.  For  instance  to
find  the  position  of  the  'CRYS'  volume  in  the
volume  bank,  the  following  piece  of  code  could  be
written:
+SEQ,GCBANK.
+SEQ,GCNUM.
           .
           .
           .
           CALL  GLOOK('CRYS',IQ(JVOLUM+1),NVOLUM,IVO)
           IF(IVO.GT.0)  THEN
                JVO  =  LQ(JVOLUM-IVO)
           ELSE
                JVO  =  0
           ENDIF


JVO,  if  different  from  0,  is  the  pointer  to  the
data  bank  containing  the  information  relative  to
the  volume  'CRYS'.



       CALL  GEVKEV                         (EGEV,ENERU*,CHUNIT*)



EGEV                      (REAL)  input,  energy  in  GeV;
ENERU                     (REAL)  output,  energy  in  the  new  unit;



CHUNIT                    (CHARACTER*4)  unit  in  which  the  energy
                          has  been  converted.


This  subroutine  converts  the  input  energy  in  GeV
to  a  unit  in  which  1< =    E< =    999.  CHUNIT  contains  the
new  unit.  The  following  piece  of  code  illustrates
the  use  of  GEVKEV:
+SEQ,GCTRAK.
           CHARACTER*4  CHUNIT
           .
           .
           .
           CALL  GEVKEV(DESTEP,  DE,  CHUNIT)
           WRITE(6,10000)  DE,  CHUNIT
10000  FORMAT('  The  energy  loss  in  this  step  is  ',F7.2,A)
