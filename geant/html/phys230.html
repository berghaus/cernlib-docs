       CALL  GPHINI



GPHINI  steers  initialisation  of  the  constants.  It
calls  GHPRIN  for  initialisation  of  the  atom  decay
rates,  GHSLIN  to  initialise  atomic  shell
potentials  and  ionisation  energies  and  GPHXIN  for
the  initialisation  of  the  cross-section
constants.  It  is  called  by  GPHOTI.



       CALL  GPHRIN



Initialisation  of  the  atom  decay  rates.  The
routine  is  called  by  GPHINI.



       CALL  GSHLIN



Initialisation  of  the  atomic  shell  potentials  and
ionisation  energies.  GSHLIN  is  called  by  GPHINI.



       CALL  GPHXIN



Initialisation  of  the  cross-section  constants
for  elements  with  Z  < =   100.  It  is  called  by  GPHINI.



       CALL  GPHXSI



GPHXSI  is  called  by  GPHYSI  for  every  tracking
medium.  It  calculates  the  cross-section
coefficients.  The  results  of  the  calculations  are
stored  in  the  photoelectric  effect  constants  bank
created  by  this  routine.



       CALL  GFSHDC



GFSHDC  calls  GFRDT,  GNRDT  and  GFSDPR  for  the
probabilities  of  atomic  state  transitions  and  the
transition  energies  and  stores  them  in  the  ZEBRA
bank.  It  is  called  by  GPHXSI.



       CALL  GFSHLS



GFSHLS  returns  the  shell  potentials  in  eV  for  an
atom.  It  is  called  by  GFSHDC.



       CALL  GFRDT



GFRDT  returns  probability  distribution  and
energies  of  the  atomic  radiative  transitions.  It
is  called  by  GFSHDC.



       CALL  GNFRDT



GNFRDT  returns  probability  distribution  and
energies  of  the  non-radiative  atomic
transitions.  It  is  called  by  GFSHDC.



       CALL  GFSDPR



GFSDPR  returns  probability  of  the  shell  radiative
decay.  It  is  called  by  GFSHDC.



       CALL  GPHOTI



GPHOTI  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for  the
photoelectric  effect.  It  tabulates  the  mean  free
path,  lambda            = 1/ Sigma           (in  cm),  as  a  function  of
the  medium  and  the  energy.  If  Z< =    100  then  it
calls  the  function  GPHSG1  for  the  total
cross-section.  Otherwise  GPHSIG  function  is
used.  GPHOTI  is  called  at  initialisation  time  by
GPHYSI.



       VALUE    =    GPHSG1                            (EGAM)



GPHSG1  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for
photoelectric  effect.  It  is  called  by  GPHOTI  for
Z< =    100.



       VALUE    =    GPHSIG                            (Z,EGAM)



GPHSIG  calculates  the  total  cross-section  for  the
photoelectric  effect  of  a  photon  with  energy  EGAM
in  material  with  atomic  number  Z>100.  It  is
called  by  GPHOTI.

For  media  with  Z< =    100  we  use  SANDIA
parametrisation  .  The  cross-section  for  elements
was  fitted  with  a  linear  combination  of
reciprocal  powers  of  the  photon  energy  E
                                              gamma

(E                in  keV).  The  fits  were  performed  in
  gamma

different  intervals  j  of  the  photon  energy.  In



such  an  interval  the  cross-section  reads  as:


                                                                         2                                     3                   *

with  j  changing  from  1  to  m   ,  where  m     is  the
                                 i             i

number  of  fitting  intervals  used  for  element  i.



For  the  composites  or  mixtures  of  N  elements  the

                     th
cross-section  for  j        interval  is  calculated  as:



                                                            N
                                            mu        = sum        f   mu                                                   (2)
                                                  j      k=1        k        j,k



                                               th
where  f     is  the  fraction  by  mass  of  k        element  in
        k

the  material.  Substituting  (??    )  into  (??    )  one
finds  that  the  cross-section  coefficients  can  be
calculated  as:



                                                                 N
                                     C                     = sum        f   C                                               (3)

for  i  from  1  to  4.  The  macroscopic  cross-section
is  calculated  as  follows:


                                                                              -1
                                       Sigma          = rho     mu         (cm      )                                       (4)


where  rho       is  the  medium  density.


As  follows  from  (??    )  each  compound  is  decomposed
to  its  components  which  should  coincide  with
chemical  elements.  If  this  is  not  the  case  i.e.  a
component  has  a  non-integer  atomic  number  Z     and
                                                 x

is  created  by  a  call  to  GSMATE  then  the
cross-section  constants  are  calculated  using  two
elements  with  Z    = integer(Z   )  and  Z    = Z    + 1
                 1              x           2      1

applying  the  weights  w    = Z   - Z     and  w    = Z   - Z
                         1      2     x          2      x     1

respectively.

<PRE>


Originally  the  parametrisation  described  below
was  developed  for  the  elements  with  the  atomic
number  Z  between  5  and  100.  Lacking  more  accurate
data  and  assuming  that  there  are  no  dramatic
changes  of  the  cross-section  behaviour  this
method  (i.e.  GPHSIG  function)  is  used  for  Z>100.

given  by

<H2>Photoelectric  effect  Bank</H2>


<PRE>


The  banks  connected  to  the  photoelectric  effect
are  created  during  initialisation  for  each
tracking  medium.  PHXS  bank  (data  area)  The  total
cross-section  values  are  stored  in  PHOT  bank  in
energy  bins  set  within  the  array  ELOW  (common
CGMULO).  This  bank  is  pointed  by  JPHOT  link.  The
first  structural  link  of  PHOT  supports  the  PHXS
bank.  For  each  energy  interval  of  the
cross-section  we  store  the  upper  limit  of  the
interval  and  four  constants  of  equation  (??    ).  For
each  chemical  element  used  to  build  the  medium  a
PHFN  bank  is  created.  This  bank,  pointed  by  a
structural  link  of  the  PHXS  bank,  contains  the
data  needed  for  the  photoelectric  effect  final
state  simulation.  All  data  word  are  of  the
Fortran  REAL  type.  The  descriptions  of  the  PHXS
and  PHFN  banks  are  given  below.
