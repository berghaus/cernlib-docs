</PRE>  <HR>  <H2>Storing  secondary  tracks  in  the
stack</H2>


<PRE>



       CALL  GSKING                         (IT)



IT                        (INTEGER)  number  of  the  track  to  be
                          stored  for  subsequent  tracking,  if  IT=0
                          all  secondary  tracks  generated  in  the
                          current  step  are  stored  for  tracking.


During  transport,  particles  can  generate  new
particles,  called  secondary.  In  GEANT  these
particles  are  stored  in  the  common  /GCKING/  (see
[BASE030]  for  an  explanation  of  the  variables  in
this  common).  The  number  of  particles  generated
in  the  current  step  is  NGKINE  (common  /GCKING/).
If  no  user  action  is  taken,  the  variable  NGKINE  is
reset  to  0  at  the  beginning  of  the  subsequent  step
and  these  particles  are  not  transported.


To  be  transported  by  GEANT,  these  particles  need
to  be  stored  in  the  data  structure  JSTAK  (see
[TRACK399])  which  normally  is  a  LIFO  stack:  the
last  particle  generated  is  the  first  one  to  be
tracked  when  the  current  one  stops.  The  order  of
tracking  can  be  changed  by  the  user,  plase  see
[TRAK310]  for  more  information  on  this  subject.


The  routine  GSKING  moves  particles  from  the
/GCKING/  common  to  the  JSTAK  structure,  where
GEANT  looks  for  particles  to  transport.


When  a  particle  is  fetched  from  the  JSTAK  data
structure,  its  place  is  freed  for  a  new  one,  so
the  information  on  the  initial  kinematics  of  this
track  is  lost.  It  may  be  useful  in  some  occasion
to  record  the  initial  kinematic  of  a  track  and
save  it  till  the  end  of  the  event.  This  is
accomplished  by  storing  the  particle  information
both  in  the  JSTAK  data  structure  and  in  the
JVERTX/JKINE  one,  which  is  permanent  throughout
the  life  of  the  event.  As  already  said  in
[KINE100],  this  should  not  be  done  by  the  user



calling  directly  the  GSVERT/GSKINE  routines
during  tracking,  but  rather  controlling  the
action  of  GSKING  via  the  array  IFLGK  in  common
/GCKING/.  If  the  particle  number  IG  generated  in
the  current  step  (1  < =     IG  < =     NGKINE)  is  being
moved  to  the  JSTAK  stack,  either  singularly  or
together  with  all  the  other  particles  generated
in  the  current  step  (setting  the  argument  of
GSKING  to  0),  the  action  performed  depends  on
IFLGK(IG):


IFLGK(IG)<0                          the  particle  is  ignored;
                =0                   the  particle  is  stored  on  the
                                     temporary  stack  JSTAK  to  be
                                     transported;
                =1                   the  particle  is  stored  on  the
                                     temporary  stack  JSTAK  to  be
                                     transported  and  in  the  JKINE  data
                                     structure  attaching  it  to  a  vertex
                                     created  in  the  current  position
                                     (array  VECT(I),  I=1,3  in  the
                                     /GCTRAK/  common);
                >1                   the  particle  is  stored  on  the
                                     temporary  stack  JSTAK  to  be
                                     transported  and  in  the  JKINE  data
                                     structure  attaching  it  to  vertex
                                     number  IFLGK(IG),  which  must  exist.


If  IFLGK(IG)>0,  after  the  call  to  GSKING,
IFLGK(IG)  is  set  to  the  newly  created  track
number  in  JKINE.  The  number  of  the  vertex  used  is
returned  in  IFLGK(NGKINE+1).  This  feature  allows
the  user  to  identify  the  created  vertex  and
tracks  via  the  routines  GSVERU  and  GSKINU  (see
[KINE100]).

Example


In  case  of  a  hadronic  interaction,  discard  the
neutrinos,  store  the  protons  in  the  permanent
data  structure  JVERTX/JKINE,  and  store  all  the
other  particles  produced  in  the  temporary  stack.


Add  to  the  protons  in  the  JKINE  bank  the  JVOLUM
and  copy  number  of  the  volume  and  the  number  of
the  tracking  medium  where  they  have  been  produced
by  an  interaction.
