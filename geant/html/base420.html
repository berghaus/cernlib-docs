       CALL  GRNDM                       (VEC*,LEN)



VEC                       (REAL)  vector  containing  the  generated
                          random  number;
LEN                       (INTEGER)  number  of  random  numbers  to
                          generate.


GRNDM  generates  a  sequence  of  uniformly
distributed  random  numbers  in  the  interval  (0,1).
The  numbers  are  returned  in  a  vector.  The  code  is
a  copy  of  the  CERN  Program  Library  routine
RANECU    (entry  V114).


Several  independent  sequences  can  be  defined  and
used.  Each  sequence  must  be  initialised  by  the
user,  otherwise  the  result  is  unpredictable.  Two
integer  seeds  are  used  to  initialise  a  sequence.
Not  all  pairs  of  integers  define  a  good  random
sequence  or  one  which  is  independent  from  others.
Sections  of  the  same  random  sequence  can  be
defined  as  independent  sequences.  The  period  of

                     60          18
the  generator  is  2       ss 10      .  A  generation  has  been
performed  in  order  to  provide  the  seeds  to  start
any  of  the  generated  sections.  There  are  215

                                              9
possible  seed  pairs  and  they  are  all  10     numbers
apart.  Thus  a  sequence  started  from  one  of  the

                       9
seed  pairs,  after  10     numbers  will  start
generating  the  next  one.



       CALL  GRNDMQ                         (ISEED1,ISEED2,ISEQ,CHOPT)



ISEED1                    (INTEGER)  first  seed  of  the  sequence;
ISEED2                    (INTEGER)  second  seed  of  the  sequence;



ISEQ                      (INTEGER)  number  of  the  independent
                          sequence  of  random  numbers  referred  to
                          by  this  call.  If  ISEQ< =    0,  then  the  last
                          valid  sequence  used  will  be  addressed
                          either  for  a  save  or  a  store.  In  case  the
                          option  'G'  is  specified,  on  output  the
                          variable  will  contain  the  sequence
                          actually  used;
CHOPT                     (CHARACTER*(*))  the  action  to  be  taken:

                          '  '          if  1< =    ISEQ< =    215,  sequence  number
                                        ISEQ  will  be  initialised  with  the
                                        seeds  of  the  pre-computed
                                        independent  sequence  ISEQ.
                                        If  ISEQ< =    0  or  ISEQ>215,  sequence
                                        number  1  will  be  initialised  with
                                        the  default  seeds.  ISEED1  and
                                        ISEED2  are  ignored;

                                        generator:  the  two  integer  seeds
                                        ISEED1  and  ISEED2  will  be  returned
                                        for  sequence  ISEQ;
                          'S'           set  the  status  of  the  generator.
                                        The  two  integer  seeds  ISEED1  and
                                        ISEED2  will  be  used  to  restart  the
                                        generator  for  sequence  ISEQ.
                          'SH'          the  same  action  as  for  'S'  and

                                        and  ISEED2  in  the  event  header

Returns  a  random  number  r  distributed  as  e      .
r =- ln   (eta      )  where  eta       is  a  random  number  extracted
by  GRNDM.



       CALL  GPOISS                         (AMVEC,NPVEC*,LEN)



 AMVEC                     (REAL)  array  of  length  LEN  containing
                           the  average  values  of  the  Poisson
                           distributions  requested;
 NPVEC                     (INTEGER)  array  of  length  LEN
                           containing  the  random  numbers:  NPVEC(I)
                           is  a  random  number  with  a  Poisson
                           distribution  of  average  AMVEC(I);

                           requested.


 This  routine  extracts  integer  random  numbers
 according  to  the  Poisson  distribution.  Given  a
 Poisson  distribution  of  average  lambda           < =   16  and  r
 uniformly  distributed  between  0  and  1,  the  method
 used  is  the  following:


1.      let  P = exp       (- lambda           ),  N = 0  and  S = P;
2.      if  r< =    S  accept  N;
3.      let  N = N + 1,  P = Plambda           / N,  S = S + P  and  go  back  to
        2;


 If  lambda           >16,  a  gaussian  distribution  with

                                                   p  =================

 average  lambda             and  sigma          =    lambda            is  generated.
