I/O  with  direct  access  files  is  the  most
efficient  way  to  use  direct  access  devices.  All
the  routines  described  in  this  section  and  in
([IOPA500])  are  based  on  the  ZEBRA-RZ  package  and
the  user  is  referred  to  the  related
documentation    for  an  understanding  of  the  basic
principles.



       CALL  GRFILE                         (LUN,CHFILE,CHOPT)



LUN                       (INTEGER)  logical  unit  number;
CHFILE                    (CHARACTER*(*))  file  name;
CHOPT                     (CHARACTER*(*))  any  valid  option  for
                          RZOPEN,  RZMAKE  and  RZFILE  and  in
                          particular:

                          N             create  a  new  file;
                          U             open  an  existing  file  for  update;
                          Q             the  initial  allocation  (default
                                        1000  records)  is  in  IQUEST(10);
                          I             read  all  initialisation  data
                                        structures  (see  description  of
                                        GRIN/GROUT)  from  file  to  memory;
                          O             write  all  initialisation  data
                                        structures  from  memory  to  file;


This  routine  opens  a  file  for  direct  access  I/O  of
ZEBRA  data  structures.  By  default  the  file  is
opened  in  exchange  mode  and  the  option  W  is  added,
which  creates  an  RZ  top  level  directory  with  the
name  //LUNnn  where  nn  is  the  logical  unit  number.


The  default  allocation  of  an  RZ  directory  is
enough  for  1000  records,  which  allows  for  a  4Mb
file  with  the  standard  record  length  of  1024
words.  If  a  larger  file  is  needed,  the  size  of  the
directory  should  be  changed  when  creating  the
file.  This  can  be  done  by  assigning  to  the
variable  IQUEST(10)  in  the  common  /QUEST/  the
requested  number  of  records,  and  calling  GRFILE



with  the  option  Q  as  shown  in  the  following
example:
           COMMON  /  QUEST  /  IQUEST(100)
           .
           .
           .
           IQUEST(10)  =  5000
           CALL  GRFILE(1,'mygeom.geom','Q')



       CALL  GRMDIR                         (CHDIR,CHOPT)



CHDIR                     (CHARACTER*(*))  subdirectory  name  to
                          create;
CHOPT                     option  string:

                          '  '          create  a  subdirectory;
                          S             create  a  subdirectory  and  set  the
                                        current  directory  to  it;


This  routine  creates  an  RZ  subdirectory.



       CALL  GREND                       (LUN)



LUN                       (INTEGER)  logical  unit  number  (see
                          RZEND  in  the  ZEBRA  manual  );


Routine  to  close  an  RZ  file.  It  is  very  important
to  call  this  routine  for  all  RZ  files  open  in
write  mode.  Failure  to  do  may  result  in  the  files
being  incompletely  written  or  corrupted.
