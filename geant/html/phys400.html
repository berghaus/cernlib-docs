       CALL  GDECAY



GDECAY  is  the  control  routine  for  the  simulation
of  particle  decays  in  flight.  For  a  given  parent
particle  it  selects  from  a  list  a  two-  or
three-body  decay  mode  using  the  known  branching
ratios  and  calls  the  routines  needed  to  generate
the  vertex  and  secondary  tracks.  It  used  the
following  input  and  output:


input:                 via  common  blocks  /GCTRAK/  and  /GCKINE/
output:                via  common  block  /GCKING/


GDECAY  is  called  by  the  tracking  routines.  It
calls  the  subroutines  GDECA2  for  two-body  decay,
GDECA3  for  three-body  decay,  GLOREN  for  Lorentz
transformation  and  GDROT  for  rotation.  For  the
documentation  of  GLOREN  and  GDROT,  see  [PHYS410].



       CALL  GDECA2                         (XM0,XM1,XM2,PCM)



XM0                       (REAL)  mass  of  the  parent  particle
XM1                       (REAL)  mass  of  the  first  decay  product
XM2                       (REAL)  mass  of  the  second  decay  product
PCM(3,4)                  (REAL)  array  containing  the
                          four-vectors  of  the  decay  products


GDECA2  simulates  the  two-body  decay  with
isotropic  angular  distribution  in  the
center-of-mass  system.  It  is  called  from  GDECAY.



       CALL  GDECA3                         (XM0,XM1,XM2,XM3,PCM)



XM0                       (REAL)  mass  of  the  parent  particle
XM1                       (REAL)  mass  of  the  first  decay  product
XM2                       (REAL)  mass  of  the  second  decay  product
XM3                       (REAL)  mass  of  the  third  decay  product
PCM(3,4)                  (REAL)  array  containing  the
                          four-vectors  of  the  decay  products


GDECA3  simulates  the  three-body  decay  with
isotropic  angular  distribution  in  the
center-of-mass  system.  It  is  called  from  GDECAY.

<PRE>


   *   Upon  entry  to  GDECAY  a  binary  search  is  made  in
       a  list  of  parent  particles.  This  list  is  stored
       in  the  JPART  structure  and  currently  contains
       the  particles  defined  in  GPART  [CONS300].  If
       the  current  particle  cannot  be  found  in  the
       list,  control  is  returned  without  any  decay
       generation.  Up  to  six  decay  modes  and  their
       corresponding  branching  ratios  are  then
       extracted  from  the  JPART  data  banks  (see
       [CONS310]).
   *   A  decay  channel  is  selected  according  to  the
       branching  ratios.  If  the  sum  of  the  branching
       ratios  for  a  particle  is  not  equal  100%,  it  is
       possible  that  no  decay  is  selected.
   *   Depending  on  whether  the  two-  or  three-body
       decay  is  selected,  either  GDECA2  or  GDECA3  is
       called  to  generate  the  four-momenta  of  the
       decay  products  with  isotropic  angular
       distribution  in  the  center-of-mass  system.
   *   The  momentum  vectors  of  the  decay  products  are
       transformed  into  the  laboratory  system  and
       rotated  back  into  the  GEANT  coordinate  frame.
       The  kinematics  of  the  products  is  stored  in  the
       common  /GCKING/.
   *   When  a  particle  decays  and  no  branching  ratio
       is  defined,  then  GDECAY  calls  the  user  routine
       GUDCAY.
