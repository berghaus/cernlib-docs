<H2>GEANT  applications</H2>


<PRE>


The  GEANT  program  simulates  the  passage  of
elementary  particles  through  the  matter.
Originally  designed  for  the  High  Energy  Physics
experiments,  it  has  today  found  applications  also
outside  this  domain  in  areas  such  as  medical  and
biological  sciences,  radio-protection  and
astronautics.


The  principal  applications  of  GEANT  in  High
Energy  Physics  are:


   *   the  transport  of  particles  (tracking  in  this
       manual)  through  an  experimental  setup  for  the
       simulation  of  detector  response;
   *   the  graphical  representation  of  the  setup  and
       of  the  particle  trajectories.


The  two  functions  are  combined  in  the  interactive
version  of  GEANT.  This  is  very  useful,  since  the
direct  observation  of  what  happens  to  a  particle
inside  the  detector  makes  the  debugging  easier
and  may  reveal  possible  weakness  of  the  setup
(also  sometimes  of  the  program!).


In  view  of  these  applications,  the  GEANT  system
allows  you  to:


   *   describe  an  experimental  setup  by  a  structure
       of  geometrical  volumes.  A  MEDIUM  number  is
       assigned  to  each  volume  by  the  user  ([GEOM]).
       Different  volumes  may  have  the  same  medium
       number.  A  medium  is  defined  by  the  so-called
       TRACKING  MEDIUM  parameters,  which  include
       reference  to  the  MATERIAL  filling  the  volume
       [CONS];
   *   accept  events  simulated  by  Monte  Carlo
       generators  [KINE];
   *   transport  particles  through  the  various



       regions  of  the  setup,  taking  into  account
       geometrical  volume  boundaries  and  physical
       effects  according  to  the  nature  of  the
       particles  themselves,  their  interactions  with
       matter  and  the  magnetic  field  [TRAK],  [PHYS];
   *   record  particle  trajectories  and  the  response
       of  the  sensitive  detectors  [TRAK],  [HITS];
   *   visualise  the  detectors  and  the  particle
       trajectories  [DRAW],  [XINT].


The  program  contains  dummy  and  default  user
subroutines  called  whenever
application-dependent  actions  are  expected.


It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  to:


   *   code  the  relevant  user  subroutines  providing
       the  data  describing  the  experimental
       environment;
   *   assemble  the  appropriate  program  segments  and
       utilities  into  an  executable  program;
   *   compose  the  appropriate  data  records  which
       control  the  execution  of  the  program.


The  section  [BASE]  of  this  manual  gives  more
information  on  the  above.


Note:  the  names  of  the  dummy  or  default  user
subroutines  have  GU  or  UG  as  their  first  two
letters.

<H2>Event  simulation  framework</H2>


<PRE>


The  framework  offered  by  GEANT  for  event
simulation  is  described  in  the  following
paragraphs,  in  order  to  familiarise  the  reader
with  the  areas  where  user  interventions  are
expected.  For  each  item  we  will  indicate  in
brackets  the  relevant  section  where  more
information  can  be  found.


At  the  same  time,  the  GEANT  data  structures  are
introduced.  This  is  important  as  the  coding  to  be
provided  by  the  user  most  often  consists  of
storing  and  retrieving  information  from  data
structures,  or  reading  or  writing  data
structures.  For  simple  applications  user
routines  are  provided  as  an  interface  to  the  data
structures  partially  hiding  them  from  the  users.
For  advanced  users  of  GEANT,  some  idea  of  the
layout  of  the  data  in  memory  is  helpful.  GEANT
data  structures  are  logically  related  set  of  data



 which  are  physically  stored  in  the  /GCBANK/
 common  block.  The  position  of  each  structure  is
 contained  in  an  INTEGER  variable  which  is
 constantly  kept  up-to-date  by  ZEBRA.  By
 convention  the  names  of  these  variable,  called
 pointers  begin  with  J,  and  they  are  used  in  this
 manual  to  designate  the  structure  they  point  to.


 A  main  program  has  to  be  provided  by  the  user
 ([BASE100])  for  batch  type  operation.  For
 interactive  operation  a  main  program  is  provided,
 both  binary  and  source,  in  the  library  directory
 both  at  CERN  and  in  the  standard  distribution
 tape  of  the  CERN  Program  Library.  The  file  is
 called  gxint<ver>.<ext>,  where  <ver>  is  the
 version  of  GEANT  to  which  this  file  belongs  and
 <ext>  is  the  system-dependent  file-name
 extension  to  denote  a  FORTRAN  source  or  an  object
 file.  This  file  should  be  loaded  in  front  of  all
 other  files  when  assembling  a  GEANT  application.
 The  source  is  provided  in  case  the  user  wants  to
 modify  it,  in  particular  changing  the  size  of  the
 commons  /GCBANK/  or  /PAWC/.


 The  main  program  allocates  the  dynamic  memory  for
 ZEBRA  and  HBOOK  and  passes  control  to  the  three
 phases  of  the  run:


1.      initialisation
2.      event  processing
3.      termination


 where  in  each  of  the  three  phases  the  user  can
 implement  his  own  code  in  the  appropriate
 routines.


 </PRE>


 <H2>Initialisation</H2>


 <PRE>


 The  initialisation  is  controlled  by  the  user  in
 the  subroutine  UGINIT  who  has  the  responsibility
 to  call  the  appropriate  routines  ([BASE100]).  It
 consists  of  the  following  steps,  most  of  them
 performed  through  calls  to  GEANT  subroutines:


 GINIT                          initialise  the  GEANT  common  blocks
                                with  default  values  ([BASE030],
                                [BASE110]);
 GFFGO                          read  free  format  data  records  either
                                to  modify  the  default  options
                                ([BASE040],  [BASE110])  or  to  provide
                                information  on  the  current  run;
 GZINIT                         initialise  the  memory  manager,  the



                               link  areas  and  the  run  header  bank
                               JRUNG  ([BASE110]);
GDINIT                         initialise  the  drawing  package
                               ([DRAW]),  calling  this  routine
                               without  having  initialised  the
                               graphics  package  via  a  call  to  IGINIT
                               or  HPLINT  will  cause  GEANT  to  abort;
GPART                          (or  GSPART)  fill  the  data  structure
                               JPART  with  the  particle  properties
                               ([CONS]);
GMATE                          (or  GSMATE)  fill  the  data  structure
                               JMATE  with  the  characteristics  of  the
                               materials  used  ([CONS]);
User  code                     it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user
                               to:

                                           * define  the  geometry  of  the
                                             different  components  of  the
                                             setup  ([GEOM]),  stored  in  the
                                             JROTM  and  JVOLUM  data
                                             structures;
                                           * define  tracking  medium
                                             parameters  ([CONS],[TRAK]),
                                             stored  in  the  JTMED  data
                                             structure;
                                           * specify  which  elements  of  the
                                             geometrical  setup  should  be
                                             considered  as  sensitive
                                             detectors,  giving  a  response
                                             when  hit  by  a  particle  ([HITS]);
                                           * usually  all  done  in  a  user
                                             routine  called  UGEOM;

GGCLOS                         process  all  the  geometrical
                               information  provided  by  the  user  and
                               prepare  for  particle  transport;
GBHSTA                         book  standard  GEANT  histograms  if
                               required  by  the  user  with  the  data
                               record  HSTA  ([BASE040],  [BASE110]);
GPHYSI                         compute  energy  loss  and  cross-section
                               tables  and  store  them  in  the  data
                               structure  JMATE  ([CONS],  [PHYS]).

<H2>Event  processing</H2>


<PRE>


The  processing  phase  is  triggered  by  a  call  to  the
subroutine  GRUN  which,  for  each  event  to  be
processed,  gives  control  to  the  subroutines:


GTRIGI                    initialise  event  processing  and  create
                          the  event  header  bank  JHEAD;
GTRIG                     process  one  event;



GTRIGC                    clean  up  the  portion  of  memory  used  by
                          the  event  and  check  that  enough  time  is
                          left  for  the  next  event  ([BASE200]).


GTRIG  calls  the  following  user  routines:


GUKINE                    generates  or  reads  ([IOPA])  the
                          kinematics  of  the  event  and  stores  it  in
                          the  data  structures  JVERTX  and  JKINE
                          ([KINE]);
GUTREV                    calling  GTREVE  which  performs  the
                          following  operations  for  each  vertex  in
                          turn:

                                  1.    moves  all  the  particles  attached
                                        to  the  vertex  from  the  permanent
                                        stack  JKINE  to  the  temporary  stack
                                        JSTAK;
                                  2.    controls  the  propagation  of  each
                                        particle  though  the  setup  by
                                        calling  GUTRAK/GTRACK  ([TRAK]);
                                        each  particle  is  tracked  in  turn
                                        and  when  a  sensitive  detector  is
                                        traversed,  the  user  may  store  any
                                        useful  information  in  the  data
                                        structure  JHITS  via  the  routines
                                        described  in  the  section  [HITS];

                          The  JSTAK  data  structure  is  a  LIFO  (Last
                          In  --  First  Out)  stack.  Secondary
                          products  generated  by  the  current
                          particle  transported  are  processed
                          before  proceeding  to  the  next  particle.
                          It  is  very  important  to  understand  that
                          by  default  GEANT  does  not  follow  the
                          secondary  particles  generated.  It  is
                          the  responsibility  of  the  user  to
                          indicate  which  particles  should  be
                          followed  via  the  routines
                          GSKING/GSKPHO.
                          The  data  structure  JXYZ,  containing  the
                          coordinates  of  space  points  along  the
                          tracks,  can  be  filled  by  the  user  during
                          tracking  ([TRAK]).
GUDIGI                    simulate  the  detector  responses  for  the
                          event,  using  the  information  recorded
                          in  the  data  structure  JHITS  during
                          particle  transport,  and  store  the
                          results  in  the  data  structure  JDIGI
                          ([HITS]);
GUOUT                     perform  all  the  processing  at  the  end  of
                          the  event  and  output  the  relevant  data
                          structures  ([IOPA]).


Other  routines  called  during  the  tracking  phase
triggered  by  GTREVE  should  be  mentioned  for
completeness:



   *   hadronic  interactions  can  be  simulated  via
       either  the  GHEISHA    or  FLUKA    hadronic  shower
       generator.  In  the  subroutines  GUPHAD  and
       GUHADR  ([TRAK])  the  user  may  select  the
       hadronic  shower  generation  program  to  be  used.
       The  default  for  GEANT  is  GHEISHA;
   *   after  each  tracking  step  along  the  track,
       control  is  given  to  the  subroutine  GUSTEP.  From
       the  information  available  in  labelled  common
       blocks  the  user  is  able  to  take  the  appropriate
       action,  such  as  storing  a  hit  or  transferring  a
       secondary  product  either  in  the  stack  JSTAK  or
       in  the  event  structure  JVERTX/JKINE  via  the
       subroutine  GSKING.  In  the  subroutine  GSSTAK,
       called  by  GSKING,  a  user  routine  GUSKIP  is
       called  which  permits  skipping  any  unwanted
       track  before  entering  it  in  the  stack  for
       subsequent  transport;
   *   the  subroutine  GUSWIM  is  called  by  the  the
       routines  which  transport  charged  particles
       when  in  a  magnetic  field;  it  selects  and  calls
       the  appropriate  routine  to  transport  the
       particle.  Although  formally  a  user  routine,
       the  default  version  provided  by  GEANT  is
       usually  appropriate  for  most  situations.  The
       magnetic  field,  unless  it  is  constant  along  the
       Z  axis,  has  to  be  described  via  the  subroutine
       GUFLD.


</PRE>


<H2>Termination</H2>


<PRE>


The  termination  phase  is  under  the  control  of  the
user  ([BASE300])  via  the  routine  GULAST.  In
simple  cases  it  may  consist  of  a  call  to  the
subroutine  GLAST  which  computes  and  prints  some
statistical  information  (time  per  event,  use  of
dynamic  memory,  etc.).
</PRE>
