\Makehead{Intersection of a track with a cylinder or a plane}

\Shubr{GICYL}{(R,X1,X2,S1,S2,IC,XINT*,SINT*,PZINT*,IFLAG*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[R] ({\tt REAL}) radius of cylinder in cm;
\item[X1] ({\tt REAL}) array of 6, ($x$, $y$, $z$, $dx/ds$, 
$dy/ds$, $dz/ds$) of 1$^{st}$ point;
\item[X2] ({\tt REAL}) array of 6, ($x$, $y$, $z$, $dx/ds$, 
$dy/ds$, $dz/ds$) of 2$^{nd}$ point;
\item[S1] ({\tt REAL}) track length $s$ at 1$^{st}$ point;
\item[S2] ({\tt REAL}) track length $s$ at 2$^{nd}$ point;
\item[IC] ({\tt INTEGER}) type of interpolation:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[1] straight line defined as ({\tt Xi(1),Xi(2),Xi(3)}) + $s$
({\tt Xi(4),Xi(5),Xi(6)}), where {\tt i} is {\tt 1} or {\tt 2} according
to which of the two points is {\it inside} the cylinder;
\item[2] straight line going from ({\tt X1(1),X1(2),X1(3)}) to
({\tt X2(1),X2(2),X2(3)});
\item[3] third degree curve with:
\[
\vec{P}(s)  =  \vec{a} \; s^3 + \vec{b} \; s^2 +\vec{c} \; s +\vec{d} 
\hspace{1.2cm}
\mbox{\tt X}i   =  \left ( \vec{P}(\mbox{\tt S}i), \; 
\left . \frac{d\vec{P}}{ds} \right |_{s=\mbox{\tt S}i} \right ) \hspace{5mm}
i=1,2
\]
\end{DLtt}
\item[XINT] ({\tt REAL}) array of 6 $x$, $y$, $z$, $dx/ds$, $dy/ds$, $dz/ds$ 
at intersection point;
\item[SINT] ({\tt REAL}) {\tt S} at intersection point;
\item[PZINT] ({\tt REAL}) $\phi$, $z$, $d\phi/dr$, $dz/dr$ in
cylindrical coordinates at intersection point;
\item[IFLAG] ({\tt INTEGER}) return flag:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[0] track does not intersect cylinder;
\item[1] track intersects cylinder.
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}
Calculates intersection of track with a cylinder
of radius {\tt R}. The track is approximated by a cubic
in the track length. To improve stability, the coordinate system
is shifted.

\Shubr{GIPLAN}{(YC,X1,X2,S1,S2,IC,XINT*,SINT*,PZINT*,IFLAG*)}
The arguments have the same meaning than in the previous routine, apart from:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[YC] ({\tt REAL}) $y$ coordinate of plane;
\end{DLtt}
Calculates intersection of track with a plane parallel to $x-z$.
The track is approximated by a cubic
in the track length. To improve stability, the coordinate system
is shifted.

{\bf Note}: the default accuracy is 10 microns. The value
of {\tt EPSI} (internal variable) must be changed for a better precision.
