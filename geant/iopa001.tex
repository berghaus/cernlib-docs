\Makehead{The I/O  routines}
The I/O routines allow one to read, write or print the
{\tt GEANT} data structures. All {\tt GEANT} I/O is handled though
the {\tt ZEBRA} system, which provides the following facilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item native and machine independent I/O to and from disk and tape
devices;
\item sequential and direct access I/O (from disk);
\end{itemize}

This allows, for example, to generate events on one machine, dump
the data structures to a mass storage device, and then read them
back for further processing on a different machine.

This section describes the various routines for I/O in {\tt GEANT}.
For a complete reference on the {\tt ZEBRA} I/O system the user
is referred to the {\tt ZEBRA} documentation~\cite{bib-ZEBRAFZ,bib-ZEBRA}.
