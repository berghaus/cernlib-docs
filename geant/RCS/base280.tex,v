\Makehead{Storing and retrieving {\tt JRUNG} and {\tt JHEAD} information}

\Shubr{GSRUNG}{(NUBUF,UBUF,IADR*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[NUBUF] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of user words;
\item[UBUF] ({\tt REAL}) array of user words;
\item[IADR] ({\tt INTEGER}) position where information is stored in the
user bank of the {\tt JRUNG} structure.
\end{DLtt}

This routine stores the first {\tt NUBUF} words of array {\tt BUF} in the
user bank attached to the structure {\tt JRUNG} (see {\tt [BASE299]}),
starting at location {\tt IADR+1}.
On exit {\tt IADR} is set to {\tt IADR+NUBUF}, allowing subsequent filling. 
This allows effectively 
to {\it add} information to the current {\tt JRUNG} bank, whether or not it has 
already an user buffer.

\Shubr{GFRUNG}{(NWRUNG*,IRUNG*,NUBUF*,UBUF*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[NWRUNG] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of words in {\tt JRUNG} bank;
\item[IRUNG] ({\tt REAL}) content of {\tt JRUNG} bank;
\item[NUBUF] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of user words;
\item[UBUF] ({\tt REAL}) array of user words;
\end{DLtt}

This routine retrieves the content of the {\tt JRUNG} bank and of the
user information added, if any.

\Shubr{GPRUNG}{}

This routine prints the content of the {\tt JRUNG} bank and of the
user information added, if any.

\Shubr{GSHEAD}{(NUBUF,UBUF,IADR*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[NUBUF] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of user words;
\item[UBUF] ({\tt REAL}) array of user words;
\item[IADR] ({\tt INTEGER}) position where information is stored in the
user bank of the {\tt JHEAD} structure.
\end{DLtt}

This routine stores the first {\tt NUBUF} words of array {\tt BUF} in the
user bank attached to the structure {\tt JHEAD} (see {\tt [BASE299]}),
starting at location {\tt IADR+1}.
On exit {\tt IADR} is set to {\tt IADR+NUBUF}, allowing subsequent filling. 
This allows effectively 
to {\it add} information to the current {\tt JHEAD} bank, whether or not it has 
already an user buffer.

\Shubr{GFHEAD}{(NWHEAD*,IHEAD*,NUBUF*,UBUF*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[NWHEAD] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of words in {\tt JHEAD} bank;
\item[IHEAD] ({\tt REAL}) content of {\tt JHEAD} bank;
\item[NUBUF] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of user words;
\item[UBUF] ({\tt REAL}) array of user words;
\end{DLtt}

This routine retrieves the content of the {\tt JHEAD} bank and of the
user information added, if any.

\Shubr{GPHEAD}{}

This routine prints the content of the {\tt JHEAD} bank and of the
user information added, if any.
