\section{Subroutines}

\Shubr{GFLUCT}{(DEMEAN,DE*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[DEMEAN] ({\tt REAL}) average energy loss according
to the energy loss tables;
\item[DE] ({\tt REAL}) actual energy loss.
\end{DLtt}

\Rind{GFLUCT} selects the method to sample the
fluctuations around the mean energy loss \Rind{DEMEAN}
and returns the energy loss \Rind{DE} in the current step.

If $\delta$-rays are not produced ({\tt DRAY=0}),
it calls \Rind{GLANDG} when the current particle and
material parameters are in the validity range of
Landau theory, \Rind{GVAVIV} when in the range of
Vavilov theory, or performs a Gaussian sampling.
For fluctuations in small steps \Rind{GLANDZ} is called.

If $\delta$-rays are produced ({\tt DRAY=1}),
it calls \Rind{GLANDZ} which, the cut for the
$\delta$-ray production being set, does sampling
from restricted formula.

\Rind{GFLUCT} is called from the tracking routines
\Rind{GTELEC}, \Rind{GTHADR}
and \Rind{GTMUON} when the {\tt LOSS} flag is set
to {\tt 1}, {\tt 2} or {\tt 3}. 

\Shubr{GLANDG}{(YRAN*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[YRAN] ({\tt REAL}) random variable distributed according to the Landau
distribution;
\end{DLtt}

\Rind{GLANDG} samples from the Landau distribution.
It is called from \Rind{GFLUCT}.

\Sfunc{GVAVIV}{VALUE = GVAVIV(RKAPPA,BETA2,RAN)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[RKAPPA] ({\tt REAL}) $\kappa$ parameter of the Vavilov 
distribution (see below);
\item[BETA2] ({\tt REAL}) $\beta^2$ of the particle;
\item[RAN] ({\tt REAL}) random number uniformly distributed in ]0,1[.
\end{DLtt}


\Rind{GVAVIV} samples samples the variable
$\lambda = \lambda_v/\kappa - \ln \kappa$, sometimes called the
Landau $\lambda$, where $\lambda_v$ is distributed according
to the Vavilov distribution. For more details see below.
It is called from \Rind{GFLUCT}. 

\Shubr{GLANDZ}{(Z,STEP,P,E,DEDX,DE*,POTI,POTIL)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[Z] ({\tt REAL}) atomic number of the medium;
\item[STEP] ({\tt REAL}) step size in cm;
\item[P] ({\tt REAL}) momentum of the particle in GeV c$^{-1}$;
\item[E] ({\tt REAL}) total energy of the particle in GeV;
\item[DEDX] ({\tt REAL}) average energy loss in the step according to
the energy loss tables;
\item[DE] ({\tt REAL}) actual energy loss in the step;
\item[POTI] ({\tt REAL}) average ionisation potential for the medium;
\item[POTIL] ({\tt REAL}) logarithm of the average ionisation potential.
\end{DLtt}

\Rind{GLANDZ} gives the energy loss {\tt DE} for the
current particle with energy {\tt E} and momentum {\tt P}
in a material of atomic number {\tt Z} where the average
energy loss is {\tt DEDX} and the current step length {\tt STEP}.
It is called from \Rind{GFLUCT} for restricted Landau
fluctuations when $\delta$-rays are produced or to sample
the fluctuations in thin layers (with or without $\delta$-ray
production).

\section{Method}
Due to the statistical nature of ionisation energy loss, large
fluctuations can occur in the amount of energy deposited by a
particle traversing an absorber element.
As recently reviewed \cite{bib-PATR}, continuous processes such as multiple
scattering and energy loss play a relevant role in the longitudinal and
lateral development of electromagnetic and hadronic showers, and
in the case of
sampling calorimeters the measured resolution can be significantly
affected by such fluctuations in their active layers.
The description of ionisation
fluctuations is characterised by the significance parameter $\kappa$,
which is proportional
to the ratio of mean energy loss to the maximum allowed energy transfer
in a single collision with an atomic electron
\[
\kappa =\frac{\xi}{E_{max} }
\]
$ E_{max} $
is the maximum transferable energy in a single collision with
an atomic electron.
\[
E_{max} =\frac{2 m_e \beta^2\gamma^2 }
{1 +  2\gamma m_e/m_x + \left ( m_e/m_x\right)^2},
\]
where $\gamma = E/m_x$, $E$ is energy and
$m_x$ the mass of the incident particle, 
$\beta^2 = 1 - 1/\gamma^2$ and $m_e$ is the electron mass. 
$\xi$ comes from the Rutherford scattering cross  section
and is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray*} \xi  = \frac{ 2\pi z^2 e^4 N_{Av} Z \rho \delta x}
        { m_e \beta^2 c^2 A} =  153.4 \frac{z^2} {\beta^2} \frac{Z}{A}
  \rho \delta x \mbox{\hspace{0.5cm}keV},
\end{eqnarray*}
where

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$z$          & charge of the incident particle \\
$N_{Av}$     & Avogadro's number \\
$Z$          & atomic number of the material \\
$A$          & atomic weight of the material \\
$\rho$       & density \\
$ \delta x$  & thickness of the material \\
\end{tabular}

$\kappa$ measures the contribution of the collisions
with energy transfer close to $E_{max}$.
For a given absorber, $\kappa$ tends towards large
values if
$\delta x$ is large and/or if $\beta$ is small.
Likewise, $\kappa$ tends towards zero if $\delta x $
is small and/or if $\beta$
approaches 1.

The value of $\kappa$ distinguishes two regimes which occur in the description
of ionisation fluctuations :
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item A large number of collisions involving the loss of all or most
of the incident particle energy during the traversal of an
absorber.

As the total energy transfer is composed of a multitude of small energy
losses, we can apply the central limit theorem and describe the
fluctuations by a Gaussian distribution.
This case is applicable to non-relativistic particles and is described by
the inequality  $\kappa > 10  $
(i.e. when the mean energy loss in the absorber is greater than
the maximum energy transfer in a single collision).

\item
Particles traversing thin counters and incident electrons under any conditions.

The relevant inequalities and distributions are
 $ 0.01 < \kappa < 10 $, Vavilov distribution, and
$\kappa < 0.01 $, Landau distribution.
\end{enumerate}

An additional regime is defined by
the contribution of the collisions with low energy transfer
which can be estimated with the relation $\xi/I_0$, where $I_0$
is the mean ionisation potential of the atom.
Landau theory assumes that the number of these collisions
is high, and consequently, it has a restriction $\xi/I_0 \gg 1$.
In {\tt GEANT}, the limit of Landau theory has been set at $\xi/I_0 = 50$.
Below this limit special models taking into account the
atomic structure of the material are used. 
This is important in thin layers and gaseous materials.
Figure \ref{fg:phys332-1} shows the behaviour of $\xi/I_0$ 
as a function of the layer thickness for an electron of
100 keV and 1 GeV of kinetic energy in Argon, Silicon and Uranium.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
   \centering
   \epsfig{file=eps/phys332-1.eps,width=14cm}
   \caption{The variable $\xi/I_0$ can be used to measure the 
            validity range of the Landau theory. It depends
            on the type and energy of the particle, $Z$, $A$
            and the ionisation potential of the material and
            the layer thickness. 
            }

\end{figure}

In the following sections, the different theories and models
for the energy loss fluctuation are described. First, the
Landau theory and its limitations are discussed, and then,
the Vavilov and Gaussian straggling functions and the
methods in the thin layers and gaseous materials are presented.

\subsection{ Landau theory}
\label{sec:phys332-1}
For a particle of mass $m_x$ traversing a thickness of material
$\delta x $,
the Landau probability distribution  may be written in terms of the
universal Landau \cite{bib-LAND}, \cite{bib-KOL3} function $\phi(\lambda)$ as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
f( \epsilon , \delta x ) & = &\frac{1}{\xi} \phi ( \lambda )    
\end{eqnarray*}
where
\begin{eqnarray*}
\phi(\lambda )& = & \frac{1} {2 \pi i}\int^{c+i\infty}_{c-i\infty}
\exp \left ( u \ln u + \lambda u \right ) du \hspace{2cm} c \geq 0 \\
\lambda       & = & \frac{\epsilon  -\bar{\epsilon} }{\xi}
  - \gamma' - \beta^2 - \ln \frac{\xi} {E_{\rm max}}          \\
\gamma' & = & 0.422784\dots = 1 - \gamma \\
\gamma             & = & 0.577215\dots \mbox{(Euler's constant)}   \\
\bar{\epsilon}  & = & \mbox{average energy loss}                    \\
\epsilon      & = & \mbox{actual energy loss}
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsubsection{Restrictions}
The Landau formalism makes two restrictive assumptions :
\begin{enumerate}
\item The typical energy loss is small compared to the maximum energy
loss in a single collision.
This restriction is removed in the Vavilov theory (see section 
\ref{vavref}).
\item
The typical energy loss in the absorber should be large compared
to the binding energy of the most tightly bound electron.
For gaseous detectors, typical energy losses are a few
keV which is comparable to the binding energies of the inner electrons.
In such cases a more sophisticated approach which accounts for atomic
energy levels (see for instance Talman \cite{bib-TALM}) is necessary
to accurately simulate data distributions. In {\tt GEANT}, a parameterised
model by L. Urb\'{a}n is used (see section \ref{urban}).
\end{enumerate}

In addition, the average value of the Landau distribution
is infinite. Summing the Landau fluctuation
obtained to the average energy from the $dE/dx$ tables, we
obtain a value which is larger than the one coming from the table.
The probability to sample a large value is small, so it takes a
large number of steps (extractions) for the average fluctuation to
be significantly larger than zero. This introduces a dependence of the
energy loss on the step size which can affect calculations.

A solution to this has been to introduce a limit on the value of the
variable sampled by the Landau distribution \cite{bib-JONE},
in order to keep the
average fluctuation to 0. The value obtained from the \Rind{GLANDO}
routine is:
\[
\delta dE/dx = \epsilon - \bar{\epsilon} = \xi ( \lambda - \gamma'
+\beta^2 +\ln \frac{\xi}{E_{max}})
\]
In order for this to have average 0, we must impose that:
\[
\bar{\lambda} = -\gamma' - \beta^2 -\ln \frac{\xi}{E_{max}}
\]

This is realised introducing a $\lambda_{max}(\bar{\lambda})$ such that
if only values of $\lambda \leq \lambda_{max}$ are accepted, the average
value of the distribution is $\bar{\lambda}$.

A parametric fit to the universal Landau distribution has been performed,
with following result:

\[
\lambda_{max} = 0.60715 + 1.1934\bar{\lambda}+(0.67794+0.052382\bar{\lambda})
\exp(0.94753+0.74442\bar{\lambda})
\]

only values smaller than $\lambda_{max}$ are accepted, otherwise the
distribution is resampled.



\subsection{Vavilov theory}
\label{vavref}
Vavilov \cite{bib-VAVI} derived a more accurate straggling
distribution by introducing the kinematic limit on the maximum
transferable energy in a single collision, rather than using
$ E_{max} = \infty $. Using the notations of \cite{bib-SCH1} we can write:
\begin{eqnarray*}
f \left ( \epsilon, \delta s \right ) & = & \frac{1}{\xi} \phi_{v}
\left ( \lambda_{v}, \kappa, \beta^{2} \right )
\end{eqnarray*}
 
where
 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\phi_{v} \left ( \lambda_{v}, \kappa, \beta^{2} \right ) & = &
\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int^{c+i\infty}_{c-i\infty}\phi \left( s \right ) 
e^{\lambda s} ds \hspace{2cm} c \geq 0 \\
\phi \left ( s \right ) & = & 
\exp \left [ \kappa ( 1 + \beta^{2}\gamma ) \right ]
~ \exp \left [ \psi \left ( s \right ) \right ], \\
\psi \left ( s \right )  & = & s \ln \kappa + ( s + \beta^{2} \kappa )
\left [ \ln (s/\kappa) + E_{1} (s/\kappa) \right ] - \kappa e^{-s/\kappa}, 
\end{eqnarray*}
and
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{1}(z) & = & \int^{\infty}_{z} t^{-1} e^{-t} dt 
\mbox{\hspace{1cm} (the exponential integral)} \\
\lambda_v & = & \kappa \left [ \frac{\epsilon - \bar{\epsilon}}{\xi}
- \gamma' - \beta^2 \right]
\end{eqnarray*}
The Vavilov parameters are simply related to the Landau parameter
by $\lambda_L = \lambda_v/\kappa - \ln\kappa $. It can be shown that 
as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$, the distribution of the variable $\lambda_L$ 
approaches that of Landau. For $\kappa \leq 0.01$ the two distributions
are already practically identical. Contrary
to what many textbooks report, the Vavilov distribution {\em
does not} approximate the Landau distribution for small $\kappa$, 
but rather the distribution of
$\lambda_L$ defined above tends to the distribution of the
true $\lambda$ from the Landau density function. 
Thus the routine \Rind{GVAVIV} samples the 
variable $\lambda_L$ rather than $\lambda_v$. 
For $\kappa \geq 10$ the Vavilov distribution tends to a
Gaussian distribution (see next section).
 
\subsection{Gaussian Theory}
 
Various conflicting forms have been proposed for Gaussian straggling
functions, but most of these appear to have little theoretical or
experimental basis.
However, as noted by Schorr \cite{bib-SCH1} it has been demonstrated 
by Seltzer and Berger \cite{bib-SELT}
that for $\kappa \geq 10 $ 
the Vavilov distribution can be replaced by a Gaussian of the form :
\begin{eqnarray*}
f( \epsilon , \delta s)  \approx \frac{1}
{\xi \sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{\kappa} \left( 1 - \beta^2/2 \right)}}
   \exp \left [ \frac{( \epsilon - \bar{\epsilon} )^2}{2} \frac{\kappa}
   {\xi^2 (1- \beta^2/2)}\right ]
\end{eqnarray*}
thus implying 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{mean} & = & \bar{\epsilon} \\
\sigma^2   & = & \frac{\xi^2}{\kappa} (1-\beta^2/2) = \xi E_{max} (1-\beta^2/2)
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Urb\'an model}
\label{urban}
The method for computing restricted energy losses
with $\delta$-ray production above given threshold energy in 
{\tt GEANT} is
a Monte Carlo method that can be used
for thin layers.
It is fast and it can be used for any thickness of a medium.
Approaching the limit of the validity of Landau's theory, the loss
distribution approaches smoothly the Landau form as shown in
figure \ref{fg:phys332-2}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
   \centering
   \epsfig{file=eps/phys332-2.eps,width=14cm}
   \caption{Energy loss distribution for a 3 GeV electron in
            Argon as given by standard {\tt GEANT}.
            The width of the layers is given in centimeters.}
    \label{fg:phys332-2}
\end{figure}

It is assumed that the atoms have only two energy levels
with binding energy $E_1$ and $E_2$.
The particle--atom interaction will then be an excitation
with energy loss $E_1$ or $E_2$, or an ionisation
with an energy loss distributed according to a function
$g(E) \sim 1/E^2$:
\begin{equation}
g(E) = \frac{ (E_{max} + I)I}{E_{max}} \frac{1}{E^2}
\end{equation}
The macroscopic cross-section for excitations ($i=1,2$) is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sigex}
\Sigma_i = C \frac{f_i}{E_i} \frac{ \ln (2 m \beta^2 \gamma^2/E_i) - \beta^2}
             {\ln (2 m \beta^2 \gamma^2/ I) - \beta^2}(1-r)
\end{equation}
and the macroscopic cross-section for ionisation is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sigion}
\Sigma_3 = C \frac{E_{max}}{I(E_{max}+I) \ln(\frac{E_{max}+I}{I})}
           ~ r
\end{equation}
    $E_{max}$ is the {\tt GEANT} cut for $\delta$-production,
    or the maximum energy transfer minus mean
    ionisation energy, if it is smaller than this
    cut-off value.
The following notation is used:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$r, C$          & parameters of the model \\
$E_i$           & atomic energy levels \\
$I$             & mean ionisation energy \\
${f_i}$         & oscillator strengths \\
\end{tabular}

The model has the parameters $f_i$, $E_i$, $C$ and $r ~(0\leq r\leq 1)$.
The oscillator strengths $f_i$ and the atomic level energies $E_i$ should
satisfy the constraints
\begin{eqnarray}
f_1 + f_2 & = & 1  \label{eq:fisum}\\
f_1 \ln E_1 + f_2 \ln E_2 & = & \ln I \label{eq:flnsum}
\end{eqnarray}
The parameter $C$ can be defined with the help of the
mean energy loss $dE/dx$ in the following way:
The numbers of collisions ($n_i$, i = 1,2 for the excitation and 3 for
the ionisation) follow the Poissonian distribution with a mean
number $ \langle n_i \rangle $. In a step $\Delta x$ the mean number
of collisions is
\begin{equation}
\langle n_i \rangle = \Sigma_i \Delta x
\end{equation}
The mean energy loss $dE/dx$ in a step is the sum of the excitation
and ionisation contributions
\begin{equation}
\frac{dE}{dx} \Delta x = \left[ \Sigma_1 E_1 + \Sigma_2 E_2 +
                          \Sigma_3 \int_{I}^{E_{max}+I} E~g(E)~dE \right]
                         \Delta x
\end{equation}
From this, using the  equations (\ref{eq:sigex}), (\ref{eq:sigion}),
(\ref{eq:fisum}) and (\ref{eq:flnsum}),
one can define the parameter $C$
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{dE}{dx}
\end{equation}

The following values have been chosen in {\tt GEANT} for the other
parameters:

$ \begin{array}{lcl}
f_2 = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
             0   & \mbox{if $Z \leq 2$} \\
             2/Z & \mbox{if $Z > 2$} \\
             \end{array} \right.    & \Rightarrow & f_1 = 1 - f_2 \\
E_2 = 10 Z^2 \mbox{ eV}  & \Rightarrow & E_1 = \left(\frac{I}{E_{2}^{f_2}}
                                              \right)^{\frac{1}{f_1}} \\
r  = 0.4 & & \\
\end{array} $

\noindent With these values the atomic level $E_2$ corresponds approximately
the K-shell energy of the atoms and $Zf_2$ the number of K-shell
electrons. $r$ is the only variable which can be tuned freely. It
determines the relative contribution of ionisation and
excitation to the energy loss.

The energy loss is computed with the assumption that the step length
(or the relative energy loss) is small, and --- in consequence ---
the cross-section can be considered constant along the path length.
The energy loss due to the excitation is
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_e = n_1 E_1 + n_2 E_2
\end{equation}
where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are sampled from Poissonian distribution
as discussed above.
The loss due to the ionisation can be generated from the distribution
$g(E)$ by the inverse transformation method:
\begin{eqnarray}
u = F(E) &  = & \int_{I}^E g(x) dx \nonumber \\
E = F^{-1}(u) & = & \frac{I}{1 - u \frac {E_{max}}{E_{max}+I}} \\
\end{eqnarray}
where $u$ is a uniform random number between $F(I)=0$ and $F(E_{max}+I)=1$.
The contribution from the ionisations will be
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_i  = \sum_{j=1}^{n_3} \frac{I}
              {1 - u_j \frac {E_{max}}{E_{max} + I}}
\end{equation}
where $n_3$ is the number of ionisation (sampled from Poissonian
distribution). The energy loss in a step will then be
$\Delta E = \Delta E_e  + \Delta E_i$.

\subsubsection{Fast simulation for $n_3 \geq 16$}
If the number of ionisation $n_3$ is bigger than 16, a faster sampling
method can be used. The possible energy loss interval is divided
in two parts: one in which the number of collisions is large and
the sampling can be done from a Gaussian distribution and the other
in which the energy loss is sampled for each collision.
Let us call the former interval $[I, \alpha I]$ the interval A,
and the latter $[\alpha I,E_{max}]$ the interval B.
$\alpha$ lies between 1 and $E_{max}/I$.
A collision with a loss in the interval A happens with the probability
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys332-5}
P(\alpha) = \int_I^{\alpha I} g(\!E\!) \, dE =
            \frac {( E_{max} + I) (\alpha - 1)}{E_{max} \alpha}
\end{equation}
The mean energy loss and the standard deviation for this type
of collision are
\begin{equation}
\langle \Delta E(\alpha) \rangle = \frac{1}{P(\alpha)} 
        \int_I^{\alpha I} E \, g(\!E\!) \, dE =
        \frac{I \alpha \ln \alpha}{\alpha - 1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\sigma^2(\alpha) = \frac{1}{P(\alpha)}
        \int_I^{\alpha I} E^2 \, g(\!E\!) \, dE =
        I^2 \alpha \left( 1 - \frac{\alpha \ln \! ^2 \alpha}{(\alpha - 1)^2} \right)
\end{equation}
If the collision number is high , we assume that the number of the
type A collisions can be calculated from a Gaussian distribution
with the following mean value and standard deviation:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:phys332-1}
\langle n_A \rangle & = & n_3 P(\alpha) \\
\label{eq:phys332-2}
\sigma_A^2     & = & n_3 P(\alpha) ( 1 - P(\alpha))
\end{eqnarray}
It is further assumed that the energy loss in these collisions
has a Gaussian distribution with
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:phys332-3}
\langle \Delta E_A \rangle & = & n_A  \langle \Delta E(\alpha) \rangle \\
\label{eq:phys332-4}
\sigma_{E,A}^2             & = & n_A \sigma^2(\alpha)
\end{eqnarray}
The energy loss of these collision can then be sampled
from the Gaussian distribution.

The collisions where the energy loss is in the interval B
are sampled directly from
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_B = \sum_{i=1}^{n_3 - n_A} \frac{\alpha I}
            {1 - u_i \frac{E_{max} + I - \alpha I}{E_{max} + I}}
\end{equation}
The total energy loss is the sum of these two types of
collisions:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E =  \Delta E_A + \Delta E_B
\end{equation}

The approximation of equations ((\ref{eq:phys332-1}),  (\ref{eq:phys332-2}),
 (\ref{eq:phys332-3}) and  (\ref{eq:phys332-4}) can be used under
the following conditions:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:phys332-6}
\langle n_A \rangle - c \, \sigma_A            & \geq & 0 \\
\label{eq:phys332-7}
\langle n_A \rangle + c \, \sigma_A            & \leq & n_3 \\
\label{eq:phys332-8}
\langle \Delta E_A \rangle - c \, \sigma_{E,A} & \geq & 0
\end{eqnarray}
where $c \geq 4$. From the equations (\ref{eq:phys332-5}),
(\ref{eq:phys332-1}) and (\ref{eq:phys332-3}) and from
the conditions (\ref{eq:phys332-6}) and (\ref{eq:phys332-7})
the following limits can be derived:
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{min} = \frac{ (n_3 + c^2)(E_{max}+I)}
                    {n_3 (E_{max} + I) + c^2 I} \; \leq \alpha \; \leq
\alpha_{max} = \frac{ (n_3 + c^2)(E_{max}+I)}
                    {c^2 (E_{max} + I) + n_3 I}
\end{equation}
This conditions gives a lower limit to number of the ionisations $n_3$
for which the fast sampling can be done:
\begin{equation}
n_3 \; \geq \; c^2
\end{equation}
As in the conditions (\ref{eq:phys332-6}), (\ref{eq:phys332-7})
and (\ref{eq:phys332-8}) the value of $c$ is as minimum 4, one gets
$n_3 \; \geq 16$. In order to speed the simulation, the
maximum value is used for $\alpha$.

The number of collisions with energy loss in the interval B
(the number of interactions which has to be simulated
directly) increases slowly with the total number
of collisions $n_3$. The maximum number of these collisions
can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
n_{B,max} = n_3 - n_{A,min} \approx n_3 (\langle n_A \rangle 
            - \sigma_A)
\end{equation}
From the previous expressions for $\langle n_A \rangle$ and
$\sigma_A$ one can derive the condition
\begin{equation}
n_B \; \leq \; n_{B,max} = \frac{2 n_3 c^2}{n_3+c^2}
\end{equation}
The following values are obtained with $c=4$:

\begin{tabular}{llcrr}
$n_3$  & $n_{B,max}$ & & $n_3$  & $n_{B,max}$\\ \hline
16   & 16      & & 200  & 29.63\\
20   & 17.78   & & 500  & 31.01 \\
50   & 24.24   & & 1000 & 31.50 \\
100  & 27.59   & & $\infty$ & 32.00
\end{tabular}
\subsubsection{Special sampling for lower part of the spectrum}
If the step length is very small ($\leq 5$ mm in gases, $\leq$ 2-3 $\mu$m
in solids) the model gives 0 energy loss for some events.
To avoid this, the probability of 0 energy loss is computed
\begin{equation}
P( \Delta E=0) = e^{-( \langle n_1 \rangle + \langle n_2 \rangle
                     + \langle n_3 \rangle )}
\end{equation}
If the probability is bigger than 0.01 a special sampling is done,
taking into account the fact that in these cases the projectile
interacts only with the outer electrons of the atom.
An energy level $E_0 = 10$ eV is chosen to correspond to the
outer electrons. The mean number of collisions can be calculated
from 
\begin{equation}
\langle n \rangle = \frac{1}{E_0} \frac{ dE}{dx} \Delta x
\end{equation}
The number of collisions $n$ is sampled from Poissonian
distribution. In the case of the thin layers, all the
collisions are considered as ionisations and the energy loss
is computed as
\begin{equation}
\Delta E = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{E_0}
          { 1 - \frac {E_{max}}{E_{max} + E_0} u_i}
\end{equation}


\section{Implementation}

The method to be used for energy loss straggling
is chosen in {\tt GFLUCT}. 
If $\delta$-rays are produced ({\tt DRAY = 1})
above the cut value {\tt DCUTE}
and the detailed PAI simulation for straggling 
in thin layers (see PHYS334)
is not chosen ({\tt STRA = 0}, default),
{\tt GLANDZ} is called always as it samples
from the restricted distribution (the energy
loss of the $\delta$-rays which are explicitly
produced should not be taken into the energy
loss distribution).

If $\delta$-rays are not produced, the
values of $\kappa$ and $\xi /I$ are computed,
and Urb\'an, Landau, Vavilov or Gaussian model
is chosen accordingly.
If Urb\'an model is used, {\tt GLANDZ} will be
called with infinite ({\tt BIG}) value for
the $\delta$-ray production.

When Landau model is chosen, it is possible to use a routine from 
the CERN Program Library to sample
random numbers from the Landau distribution :
\Rind{GENLAN} written by James and Hancock \cite{bib-JAME} and copied 
into {\tt GEANT} source file as \Rind{GLANDG}. This routine has been modified
in order to reproduce the tail for large values of X. The original routine
did not give values of X larger than 200.
\begin{verbatim}
      CALL GENLAN(X)
\end{verbatim}
It should be noted that over the years considerable confusion has
arisen over the precise form and features of the Landau distribution.
As an example, a {\it simpler form} of $\phi(\lambda)$ had been
proposed by Moyal~\cite{bib-MOYA} and
used on occasions which has little in common with
the function defined in section \ref{sec:phys332-1} \cite{bib-KOL2}.

For the Vavilov distribution we have used the function \Rind{GVAVIV}
by Rotondi and Montagna \cite{bib-ROTO}.
