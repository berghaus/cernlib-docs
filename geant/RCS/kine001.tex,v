\Makehead{Section {\tt KINE}}
This section describes the {\tt GEANT} kinematics structures {\tt JVERTX} and
{\tt JKINE} and the routines which permit one to store and retrieve the 
information. It also contains a short description of the {\tt GEANT} 
interface to the {\tt JETSET} generator and related routines.
