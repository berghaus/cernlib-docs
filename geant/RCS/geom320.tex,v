\Makehead{Reference system transformations}
 
\Shubr{GMTOD}{(XM,XD*,IFLAG)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[XM] ({\tt REAL}) array of 3 containing the input position
({\tt IFLAG=1}) or direction cosines ({\tt IFLAG=2}) in the {\tt M}aster
{\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem;
\item[XD] ({\tt REAL}) array of 3 containing the output position
({\tt IFLAG=1}) or direction cosines ({\tt IFLAG=2}) in the 
(current) {\tt D}aughter {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem;
\item[IFLAG] ({\tt INTEGER}) transformation flag:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[1] input is a position, it must be translated and rotated;
\item[2] input is a direction, it must be rotated.
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}

This routine transform coordinates or directions from the {\tt MRS}
to the reference system of the current volume. The
\FCind{/GCVOLU/} must be properly filled, either by the tracking
routines, by \Rind{GMEDIA} or by \Rind{GLVOLU}.

\Shubr{GDTOM}{(XD,XM*,IFLAG)}
Performs the inverse operation to \Rind{GMTOD}.
