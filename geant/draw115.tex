\Makehead{Drawing a Volume Projection view -- Case 2}
\Shubr{GDRVOL}{(NNAMS,CHNAMS,LNUMBS,NRS,THETA,PHI,PSI,U0,V0,SU,SV)}
Draws an orthographic parallel projection or a perspective projection 
(depending on the option chosen via \Rind{GDOPT}) of the volume 
{\tt CHNAMS(N),LNUMBS(N)} with all its descendants, at the position 
{\tt U0,V0} (user coordinates), with the scale factors {\tt SU} and 
{\tt SV}. 
The object is seen from {\tt THETA} and {\tt PHI} angles, 
and the resulting 2D projection is also rotated by an angle {\tt PSI} 
on the screen plane. These parameters, as well as zoom parameters set 
by \Rind{GDZOOM}, define the current {\it view parameters}, and they are 
copied in \FCind{/GCDRAW/}.  Attributes like colour, fill area, line 
width, line style, visibility, etc. can be set by the \Rind{GSATT} 
routine for {\tt CHNAMS(N)} and or its descendants {\tt [GEOM 500]}.
This routine differs from \Rind{GDRAW} in the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item  The object to be drawn is identified by a full path. This gives 
the possibility of drawing a particular copy or division of a volume, or 
even a volume that has more than one mother in the geometry tree.
{\tt CHNAMS(1),...,CHNAMS(N)} contain the volume names and
{\tt LNUMBS(1),...,LNUMBS(N)}, the volume numbers defining the path 
to go from the top volume to the one to be drawn.
\item  The object can be drawn either with respect to the
{\tt MA}ster {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem ({\tt NRS=0}) or with respect 
to its {\tt D}augther {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem (i.e. the Local R.S.); 
in the first case it is drawn in its position in the real world, while 
in the second one it is drawn like \Rind{GDRAW} would do.
\item  In this latter case, track and hit points will be
drawn with respect to the {\tt DRS} of the volume last
drawn by this routine, and not with respect to the
{\tt MARS} as is done normally (to reset to the normal
case a call with {\tt NRS=0} or {\tt NNAMS=0} is required).
\end{itemize}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[NNAMS]     ({\tt INTEGER}) number of elements {\tt levels} in the 
arrays {\tt CHNAMS, LNUMBS}. The bottom volume of this path is also the 
one that is actually drawn;
\item[CHNAMS]   ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) array of volume name (dimensioned 
at least to {\tt NNAMS});
\item[LNUMBS]   array of volume numbers (dimensioned at least to {\tt NNAMS});
\item[NRS]    reference system used:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMM}
\item[NRS$=$0] to have the volume(s) drawn with respect to the {\tt MARS} 
\item[NRS$\neq$0] to have the volume(s) drawn with respect to the {\tt DRS}
\end{DLtt}
\item[THETA]   $\theta$ angle between the line of sight and the
                Z  axis of {\tt MARS};
\item[PHI]    $\phi$ angle between the projection of the line of sight
              on plane {\tt X Y} and the {\tt X} axis of {\tt MARS}
\item[PSI]   $\psi$ angle by which the projected image will
             be rotated on the screen plane
\item[U0]    u coordinate on the screen of the volume origin
\item[V0]    v  coordinate on the screen of the volume origin
\item[SU]   scale factor for u coordinates
\item[SV]   scale factor for v coordinates
\end{DLtt}
