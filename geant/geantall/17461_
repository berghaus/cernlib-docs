\Submitted{01.10.84}        \Revised{20.04.94}
\Makehead{Foreword}
As the scale and complexity of High Energy Physics experiments
increase, simulation studies require more and more care
and become essential to

\begin{itemize}
\item design and optimise the detectors,
\item develop and test the reconstruction and analysis programs, and 
\item interpret the experimental data.
\end{itemize}

{\tt GEANT} is a system of detector description and simulation tools that
help physicists in such studies.
The {\tt GEANT} system can be obtained from {\tt CERN} as six 
Patchy~\cite{bib-PATCHY}/CMZ~\cite{bib-CMZ} files:
{\tt GEANT}, {\tt GEANG}, {\tt GEANH}, {\tt GEANF}, {\tt GEANE} and {\tt GEANX}.
The program runs everywhere the CERN Program Library has been installed
\footnote{
At the moment of writing these are the systems on which the CERN Program
Library has been installed: VM/CMS-HPO-XA-ESA, SUN Sparc, Silicon Graphics,
CRAY Y-XMP, Apollo 3000 series, Apollo 10000, HP 400 series, HP 700 series,
IBM RS/6000, IBM AIX/370, VAX/VMS, Alliant, Dec Ultrix, NeXT,
IBM MVS-HPO-XA-ESA, Convex, MAC/MPW (partial implementation), Data General,
Gould, Meiko Computing Surface
T-800, Norsk Data.
}.
\par
The {\tt GEANT} and
{\tt GEANG} files contain most of the basic code. The {\tt GEANH} file
contains the code for the
hadronic showers simulation from the program {\tt GHEISHA}~\cite{bib-GHEI}.
The {\tt GEANF} file contains the source of the routines for hadronic
showers development from the 
{\tt FLUKA}~\cite{bib-FLUK,bib-FLU1,bib-FLU2,bib-FLU3,bib-FLU4,bib-FLU5,bib-FLU6}
program which is interfaced with {\tt GEANT} as an alternative to 
{\tt GHEISHA} to simulate hadronic cascades.
The {\tt GEANE}~\cite{bib-GEANE} file
contains a tracking package to be used, in the context of
event reconstruction, for trajectory estimation and error propagation.
The {\tt GEANX} file
contains
the main program for the interactive version of {\tt GEANT} (GXINT) and
a few examples of application
programs which may help users to get started with {\tt GEANT}.
\par
General information concerning {\tt GEANT}, for example
access to the source code, the list of problems and their
proposed corrections, the context of utilisation on the
CERN machines, the status of some application programs, the acquisition of
documentation, etc., are kept up to date through CERN news and
InterNet news group ({\tt cern.lgeant}) and an
electronic mailing list which is installed on the CERN IBM mainframe
(BITnet/EARN node CERNVM). The name of the list is LGEANT (see below how
to subscribe).
\par
The first version of {\tt GEANT} was written in 1974 as a bare
framework which initially emphasised tracking
of a few particles per event through relatively
simple detectors. The system has been developed
with some continuity over the years~\cite{bib-GEANT2}
\par
New versions may
differ from the previous ones.
Some of the modifications may lead to backward incompatibilities.
The user is therefore invited to read carefully the Patch {\tt HISTORY}
of the current {\tt GEANT} file where all changes are described in detail.
\par
The development and the maintenance of {\tt GEANT} are possible
only thanks to the devoted and continuous collaboration of
physicists around the world who use the program and contribute their
feedback to the authors and maintainers at CERN. It is of course
impossible
to mention all of them, and new names are added frequently to the
list of the contributors.
The {\tt GEANT} team wish to thank them all and expresses
its hope that they will continue to help us.
\par
{\tt GEANT} version 3 originated from an idea of Ren\'{e} Brun and Andy McPherson 
in 1982 during the development of the OPAL simulation program.
GEANT3 was based on the skeleton of {\tt GEANT} version 2 
code~\cite{bib-GEANT2}.
\par
In close collaboration with Ren\'{e} and Andy, Pietro Zanarini developed
the first versions of the graphics system as well as the early versions
of the interactive package initially based on {\tt ZCEDEX}, 
then upgraded to {\tt KUIP}.
\par
Glenn Patrick (RAL) implemented a first version of the electromagnetic 
processes. Tony Baroncelli (Roma) helped in interfacing {\tt GEANT} to his hadronic
shower package {\tt TATINA}. Federico Carminati contributed to the interface
with {\tt GHEISHA}, an hadronic shower package developed by Harn Fesefeldt (Aachen).
\par
Francis Bruyant and Michel Maire (LAPP) made substantial contributions 
to the geometry,
tracking and physics parts of {\tt GEANT} while adapting the system
to the L3 environment. Francis has been, for many years, an essential
collaborator, testing new ideas for the geometry and hits packages.
Michel, together with Elemer Nagy and Vincenzo Innocente, developed the 
{\tt GEANE} system.

\par
A very important contribution to {\tt GEANT} has been made by L\'{a}szl\'{o} 
Urb\'{a}n 
(KFKI Budapest) who has continuously improved the electromagnetic
physics package. Lazlo has spent a considerable amount of time in
reading the relevant papers in the literature and in making comparisons
with experimental results.

\par
Ren\'{e} Brun has coordinated the development and the maintenance of {\tt GEANT}
from 1982 until 1991 (versions 3.00 up to 3.14). Federico Carminati
coordinated the development of the versions 3.15 and 3.16 between 1991 and 1993.
Since January 1994, the responsability for {\tt GEANT} is in the hands of Simone
Giani.
Before assuming this responsability, Simone made substantial improvements
in the graphics and interactive packages. After he has enhanced the power
of the geometry package and the performance of the tracking for a new
version of {\tt GEANT}: 
in March 1994 the version 3.21 has been released and is the current version
of {\tt GEANT}.
\par
Many people contributed their
work or their experience. We have tried to acknowledge their names 
in the manual pages and we apologise for any omissions.

Special mention should be made here of
the following contributions:

S.Banerjee
(contribution to the tracking package),
R.Jones
(contribution to the 
simulation of electromagnetic processes),
K.Lassila-Perini
(interface with FLUKA and MICAP),
G.Lynch
(contribution to the multiple scattering algorithms),
E.Tchernyaev
(original code for hidden-line removal graphics).

\par
S. Ravndal did a complete revision and update of the full documentation
for the release
of {\tt GEANT} version 3.21.


Special thanks should go to the authors of the packages interfaced
with {\tt GEANT}, and in particular to Harn Fesefeldt ({\tt GHEISHA}) 
and Alfredo Ferrari ({\tt FLUKA} see later). Their
patience in explaining the internals of their code, their
experience and their 
collaborative and open attitude have been instrumental.

Another special thanks goes to Mike Metcalf, who helped to 
improve the English and the structure of the manual.

\par
Any reader who is not familiar with {\tt GEANT}
should first have a glance at the notes numbered 001 to 009 in each
section of this manual.

Despite our efforts, the documentation is still
incomplete and far from perfect. We accept full
responsibility for its present status.
 
Finally, we express our thanks to Michel Goossens for translating the 
SCRIPT/SGML source of the original {\tt GEANT} manual into \LaTeX.

\section{The GEANT-FLUKA interface}

Since version 3.15, {\tt GEANT} includes an interface with some
{\tt FLUKA}~\cite{bib-FLUK,bib-FLU1,bib-FLU2,bib-FLU3,bib-FLU4,bib-FLU5,bib-FLU6}
routines. This part has been updated and extended in subsequent releases.

{\tt FLUKA} is a standalone code with its own life. Only a few parts have been
included into {\tt GEANT}, namely the ones dealing with hadronic elastic and
inelastic interactions.

The implementation of {\tt FLUKA} routines in {\tt GEANT} does not include
any change, apart from interface ones and those agreed by the {\tt FLUKA}
authors. Whenever different options are available in {\tt FLUKA}, the one
suggested by the authors have been retained. Nevertheless the results
obtained with {\tt FLUKA} routines inside {\tt GEANT} could not be 
representative of the full {\tt FLUKA} performances, since they
generally depend on other parts which are {\tt GEANT} specific.

The routines made available for {\tt GEANT} have been extensively tested and are
reasonably robust. They usually do not represent the latest {\tt FLUKA}
developments, since the policy is to supply for {\tt GEANT} well tested
and reliable code rather than very recent developments with possibly better
physics but also still undetected errors.

It is important that {\tt GEANT} users are aware of the conditions at which
this code has been kindly made available:
\begin{itemize}
\item relevant authorship and references about 
{\tt FLUKA}~\cite{bib-FLUK,bib-FLU1,bib-FLU2,bib-FLU3,bib-FLU4,bib-FLU5,bib-FLU6}
should be clearly
indicated in any publication reporting results obtained with this code;
\item the {\tt FLUKA} authors reserve the right of publishing about 
the physical models
they developed and implemented inside {\tt FLUKA}, {\tt GEANT} users are not 
supposed to extract from the {\tt GEANT}-{\tt FLUKA} code the relevant
routines running them standalone for benchmarks;
\item more generally,
{\tt FLUKA} routines contained in the {\tt GEANF} file are supposed to be
included and used with {\tt GEANT} only: any other use must be authorised
by the {\tt FLUKA} authors.
\end{itemize}

 
\section{Documentation}
 
The main source of documentation on {\tt GEANT} is this manual. Users are
invited to notify any correction or suggestion to the authors.
 
A detailed description of the history of modifications to the {\tt GEANT} code
is contained in the \Lit{$VERSION} Patch in the {\tt GEANT} file.
 
{\tt GEANT} is part of the CERN Program Library, and problems or questions
about {\tt GEANT} should be directed to the Program Library Office (see next
section).
 
{\tt GEANT} problems can be submitted to
an InterNet discussion group {\tt cern.lgeant}.

A mailing list is maintained on CERN's central IBM machine (BITnet node
CERNVM) via the LISTSERV mechanism. LISTSERV acts as a rudimentary
conferencing system, which forwards the mail received to all subscribed
users and to the InterNet group {\tt cern.lgeant}. 
The list is accessible to all users who have an e-mail connection
to CERNVM. To subscribe to the list from a BITnet node a user has to
send the following message to LISTSERV at CERNVM using the local
BITnet message facility:

\begin{center}
\Lit{SUBSCRIBE LGEANT}
\end{center}

From a non-BITnet node, the user can send an ordinary mail message to
the user LISTSERV at CERNVM containing that single line.
 
Together with the {\tt GEANT} library comes a 
{\it correction cradle} (see section on
maintenance policy) which contains the history of the
modifications to the current
version of the {\tt GEANT} program. This file is accessible to all
users in the PRO area and can be found in:

\begin{center}
\Lit{GCORR{\it xxx}.CAR}
\end{center}

where {\it xxx} is the version number.
 
Documentation on the elements of the CERN Program Library used by the {\tt GEANT}
program is available from the CERN Program Library Office.

\section{Update policy}
The {\tt GEANT} program is constantly updated to reflect corrections, most
of the time originating from users' feed-back, and improvements to
the code. This constant evolution, which is one of the reasons for the 
success of {\tt GEANT},
poses the serious problem of managing change without disrupting stability,
which is very important for physicists doing long production runs.
 
In the CERN Program Library maintenance scheme, three versions
of any product are present at the same time on the central systems,
in the
OLD, PRO and NEW areas with those same names. This scheme does not apply to
{\tt GEANT} because every new release usually contains modifications
in the physics which can produce, we hope,
better but often different results with
respect to the previous version. It is therefore appropriate to offer to
the users
an extra level of protection against running inadvertedly the wrong version
by appending the version number to all the files of {\tt GEANT}. In this way the
users will have to change their procedure to change the
version of {\tt GEANT}.
 
On the other hand, the new user should not bother about version numbers and
correction files, and so an alias is installed on all systems without any
version number, always pointing to the latest released version.
 
As said before, users' feed-back is of paramount importance in detecting
problems or areas for improvement in the system, so the new version is made
available in the NEW area well before the official
release. If, on the one hand, those who use this version do so
at their own risk, on the other hand users are encouraged to
perform
as much testing as possible, in order to detect the maximum
number of problems before the final release. Modifications in the pre-release
version are made directly in the source code.
 
When a problem is discovered
which may seriously affect the validity of the results of the simulation,
it is of course not enough to correct it in the new version, as users who
are doing long productions would not have access to it. In this case the 
correction is
also made in the production version in the PRO area. To minimise network
transfer for remote users and in the interest of the stability of the system,
the source code of the released version in PRO is not touched, but rather
the correction is applied via a so-called {\it correction cradle} which is
a file containing the differences between the original and the corrected
version in a format required by PATCHY/CMZ. Both these programs can read the
original source and the correction cradle and produce the corrected source.
On the production area the binary libraries are re-generated and the new
correction cradle installed.
 
Users at CERN should not need to use the correction
cradle other than
for documentation purposes. Remote users may want to obtain
the cradle and apply the corrections. For this case, 
the cradle is installed on
LISTSERV where it can be retrieved by registered users. Once a new
version is released, the correction cradle is obviously empty, as all
corrections have been applied in the code directly. The correction cradle for
the OLD version is available but has to be considered frozen.
No correction is ever applied to an old version.
 
New versions of {\tt GEANT} are moved into the PRO area synchronously with
releases of the CERN Program Library. If no new version of {\tt GEANT} 
is available
at the time of the release of the Program Library, the {\tt GEANT} files do not
change their location and the production version remains the same.

\end{DLtt}

Within each section, the principal system functions or the details of
subroutines are described in a series of {\it papers} numbered from 001 to 999.
In the upper left corner it is indicated in which {\tt Geant} release 
the subroutines
were introduced and left unchanged.
The authors of the conceptual ideas or/and of the early versions of the
code are acknowledged under the item {\bf Origin}, while {\bf Revision}
contains the contributors to any important upgrade. {\bf Documentation}
is essential, but sometime implies a not negligeable amount of work. When
relevant these contributions are acknowledged here. 
In addition all reported bugs, accepted suggestions...etc...are mentioned in
the history part of the source code and correction cradle.

Subroutines which are not necessary for an understanding of
the program flow and which are not intended to be called directly by
the user have been omitted.

The notation {\tt [<KEYW>nnn]} is used whenever
additional information can be found in the quoted section.
In the description of subroutine calling sequences,
the arguments used both on input and on output
are preceded by a * and the output arguments are followed by a * .

For convenience, two more sections have been added:
the section {\tt AAAA}, for general introductory information
at the beginning, and
the section {\tt ZZZZ}, for various appendices and indexed lists, at
the end.

A table of contents is available in {\tt AAAA000}.
To ease access to this documentation an index
appears in {\tt ZZZZ999}. It gives in alphabetic order the names of all
documented {\tt GEANT} subroutines with references
to the appropriate write up(s).

A short write up of {\tt GEANT} can be obtained by collecting the papers
numbered 001 to 009 in each section.

\section{{\tt GEANT} applications}
 
The {\tt GEANT} program simulates the passage of elementary particles through
the matter. Originally designed for the High Energy Physics experiments,
it has today found applications also outside this domain in areas such as
medical and biological sciences, radio-protection and astronautics.

The principal applications of {\tt GEANT} in High Energy Physics are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the {\it transport} 
of particles ({\it tracking} in this manual)
through an experimental setup for the simulation
of detector response;
\item
the graphical representation of the setup and of the particle trajectories.
\end{itemize}

The two functions are combined in the interactive version of {\tt GEANT}.
This is very useful,
since the direct
observation of what happens to a particle inside the detector
makes the debugging easier and may reveal possible weakness of the
setup (also sometimes of the program!).

In view of these applications, the {\tt GEANT} system allows you to:
\begin{itemize}
\item
describe an experimental setup
by a structure of geometrical volumes.
A {\tt MEDIUM} number 
is assigned to each volume
by the user ({\tt [GEOM]}). Different volumes may have
the same medium number. A medium is defined by
the so-called {\tt TRACKING MEDIUM} parameters, which
include reference to the {\tt MATERIAL}
filling the volume {\tt [CONS]};
\item
accept events simulated by Monte Carlo generators {\tt [KINE]};
\item transport particles through the various
regions of the setup, taking
into account geometrical volume boundaries and
physical effects according to the nature of the
particles themselves, their interactions
with matter and the magnetic field {\tt [TRAK], [PHYS]};
\item
record particle trajectories and the response of
the sensitive detectors {\tt [TRAK], [HITS]};
\item visualise the
detectors and the particle trajectories {\tt [DRAW], [XINT]}.
\end{itemize}

The program contains {\it dummy} and {\it default}
user subroutines called whenever application-dependent
actions are expected.

It is the responsibility of the user to:
\begin{itemize}
\item code the relevant user subroutines providing the data describing the
experimental environment;
\item assemble the appropriate program segments and utilities into an 
executable program;
\item compose the appropriate data records
which control the execution of the program. 
\end{itemize}
The
section {\tt [BASE]} of this manual gives more information on the above.

{\bf Note:}
the names of the dummy or default user subroutines have {\tt GU} or {\tt UG} 
as their first two letters.
 
\section{Event simulation framework}

The framework offered by {\tt GEANT} for event simulation is described in
the following paragraphs, in order
to familiarise the reader with the areas where user
interventions are expected.
For each item we will indicate in brackets the relevant section where more
information can be found.

At the same time, the {\tt GEANT} data structures are introduced. 
This is
important as the coding to be provided by the user
most often consists of storing and retrieving information from
data structures, or reading or writing data structures.
For simple applications
user routines are provided as an interface to the data structures
partially hiding them from the users. For advanced users of 
{\tt GEANT}, some idea of the layout of the data in memory is helpful.
{\tt GEANT} data structures are logically related set of data which are
physically stored in the \FCind{/GCBANK/} common block. The position
of each structure is contained in an {\tt INTEGER} variable which
is constantly kept up-to-date by {\tt ZEBRA}. By convention the names
of these variable, called {\it pointers} begin with {\tt J}, and they
are used in this manual to designate the structure they point to.

A main program has to be provided by the user ({\tt [BASE100]}) for
{\it batch} type operation. For interactive operation a main program is
provided, both binary and source, in the library directory
both at CERN and in the standard distribution tape of the CERN Program
Library. The file is called {\tt gxint<ver>.<ext>}, where {\tt <ver>}
is the version of {\tt GEANT} to which this file belongs and {\tt <ext>}
is the system-dependent file-name extension to denote a FORTRAN source
or an object file. This file should be loaded in front of all other
files when assembling a {\tt GEANT} application. The source is provided
in case the user wants to modify it, in particular changing the size
of the commons \FCind{/GCBANK/} or \FCind{/PAWC/}.

The main program allocates the dynamic memory for {\tt ZEBRA} and 
{\tt HBOOK} and passes control to the three phases of the run:
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item initialisation
\item event processing
\item termination
\end{enumerate}

where in each of the three phases the user can implement his own code
in the appropriate routines.
 
\section{Initialisation}

The initialisation is controlled by the user in the subroutine {\tt UGINIT}  
who has the responsibility to call the appropriate routines
({\tt [BASE100]}).
It consists of the following steps, most of them
performed through calls to {\tt GEANT} subroutines:
 
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[\Rind{GINIT}]
initialise the {\tt GEANT} common blocks
with default values ({\tt [BASE030], [BASE110]});
\item[\Rind{GFFGO}]
read {\it free format} data records either to
modify the default options ({\tt [BASE040],
[BASE110]}) or to provide information on the current run;
\item[\Rind{GZINIT}]
initialise the memory manager, the link areas
and the run header bank {\tt JRUNG} ({\tt [BASE110]});
\item[\Rind{GDINIT}]
initialise the drawing package ({\tt [DRAW]}), calling this routine
without having initialised the graphics package via a call to \Rind{IGINIT}
or \Rind{HPLINT} will cause {\tt GEANT} to abort;
\item[\Rind{GPART}]
(or \Rind{GSPART}) fill the data structure {\tt JPART}
with the particle properties ({\tt [CONS]});
\item[\Rind{GMATE}] (or \Rind{GSMATE})
fill the data structure {\tt JMATE}
with the characteristics of the materials used
({\tt [CONS]});
\item[User code] it is the responsibility of the user to:
\begin{itemize}
\item define the geometry of the different components of
the setup ({\tt [GEOM]}), stored in the {\tt JROTM} and {\tt JVOLUM} data
structures; 
\item define tracking medium parameters ({\tt [CONS],[TRAK]}), stored
in the {\tt JTMED} data structure;
\item specify which elements of the geometrical
setup should be considered as {\it sensitive detectors}, giving
a {\it response} when hit by a particle ({\tt [HITS]});
\item usually all done in a user routine called \Rind{UGEOM};
\end{itemize}
\item[\Rind{GGCLOS}]
process all the geometrical information
provided by the user and prepare for particle transport;
\item[\Rind{GBHSTA}]
book standard {\tt GEANT} histograms if required by
the user with the data record {\tt HSTA} ({\tt [BASE040], [BASE110]});
\item[\Rind{GPHYSI}]
compute energy loss and cross-section tables
and store them in the data structure {\tt JMATE} ({\tt [CONS], [PHYS]}).
\end{DLtt}
 
\section{Event processing}
 
The processing phase is triggered by a call to the subroutine \Rind{GRUN} which,
for each event to be processed, gives control to the subroutines:
 
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[\Rind{GTRIGI}] initialise event processing and create the
event header bank {\tt JHEAD};
\item[\Rind{GTRIG}] process one event;
\item[\Rind{GTRIGC}] clean up the portion of memory used by the event
and check that enough time is left for the next event ({\tt [BASE200]}).
\end{DLtt}
\Rind{GTRIG} calls the following user routines:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[\Rind{GUKINE}]
generates or reads ({\tt [IOPA]})
the kinematics of the event and stores it
in the data structures {\tt JVERTX} and {\tt JKINE} ({\tt [KINE]});

\item[\Rind{GUTREV}]
calling \Rind{GTREVE} which performs the following operations for each
vertex in turn:
\begin{enumerate}
\item moves all the particles attached to the vertex from the permanent 
stack {\tt JKINE} to the temporary stack {\tt JSTAK};
\item controls the propagation of each particle though the setup by 
calling \Rind{GUTRAK}/\Rind{GTRACK} ({\tt [TRAK]}); 
each particle is tracked in turn and when a sensitive detector
is traversed, the user may store
any useful information in the data structure {\tt JHITS} 
via the routines described in the section {\tt [HITS]};
\end{enumerate}
 
The {\tt JSTAK} data structure is a LIFO (Last In -- First Out) stack.
Secondary products generated by the current particle transported
are processed before proceeding to the next particle. 
It is very important to understand that by default {\tt GEANT} does not
follow the secondary particles generated. It is the responsibility of the
user to indicate which particles should be followed via the
routines \Rind{GSKING}/\Rind{GSKPHO}.

The data structure {\tt JXYZ}, containing the
coordinates of space points along the tracks,
can be filled by the user during tracking ({\tt [TRAK]}).

\item[\Rind{GUDIGI}]
simulate the detector responses for the event, using 
the information recorded in the data
structure {\tt JHITS} during particle transport, and store
the results in the data structure {\tt JDIGI} ({\tt [HITS]});

\item[\Rind{GUOUT}]
perform all the processing at the end of the event and 
output the relevant data structures ({\tt [IOPA]}).
\end{DLtt}
 
Other routines called during the tracking phase triggered
by {\tt GTREVE} should be mentioned for completeness:
\begin{itemize}
\item
hadronic interactions can be simulated via either the 
{\tt GHEISHA}~\cite{bib-GHEI} or 
{\tt FLUKA}~\cite{bib-FLUK,bib-FLU1,bib-FLU2,bib-FLU3,bib-FLU4}
hadronic shower generator.
In the
subroutines \Rind{GUPHAD} and \Rind{GUHADR} ({\tt [TRAK]}) the user
may select the hadronic shower generation program to be used.
The default for {\tt GEANT} is {\tt GHEISHA};
\item after each tracking step along the
track, control is
given to the subroutine \Rind{GUSTEP}. From the information
available in labelled common blocks the user
is able to take the appropriate action, such as
storing a hit or transferring a secondary product either in the
stack {\tt JSTAK} or in the event structure {\tt JVERTX/JKINE} via
the subroutine 
\Rind{GSKING}. In the subroutine \Rind{GSSTAK},
called by \Rind{GSKING}, a user routine \Rind{GUSKIP} is called which permits
skipping any unwanted track before entering it in the stack for subsequent
transport;
\item the subroutine
\Rind{GUSWIM} is called by the the routines which transport charged particles
when in a magnetic field; it selects and calls the appropriate routine to
transport the particle. Although formally a user routine, the default version
provided by {\tt GEANT} is usually appropriate for most situations.
The magnetic field, unless it is constant along the {\tt Z} axis,
has to be described via the subroutine \Rind{GUFLD}.
\end{itemize}
 
\section{Termination}
 
The termination phase is under the control of the user ({\tt [BASE300]})
via the routine \Rind{GULAST}. In 
simple cases it may consist of a call to the subroutine \Rind{GLAST} 
which computes and prints some statistical information (time per
event, use of dynamic memory, etc.).

\section{Common blocks}
The communication between program segments of the {\tt GEANT} system
is assured by the contents of the data structures and by the definition
of {\it long range} variables in several common blocks.
In addition, within the program segments,
the subroutines communicate with each other through actual arguments
and through the common block variables. A detailed list of the 
user accessed common blocks is given in  {\tt [ZZZZ010]}. 
Their also the variables initialized in \Rind{GINIT} and the possibility
in overriding them through data records {\tt [BASE040]} or 
interactive commands {\tt [XINT]} are specified.
 
In most of the cases there is a correspondence between a
given data structure and a given common block where the current contents of
the banks are stored.
The labelled common blocks are accessible through Patchy/CMZ sequences
identified by the name of the {\tt COMMON}. They are defined in the Patch
\Rind {GCDES}.
 
{\bf Note:}
 
Unless otherwise specified, the long range variables are
initialised in \Rind{GINIT}. When non-zero, default values are
quoted between brackets. If the value may be modified
the keyword for the data record and for the interactive
command is also given in bold characters between brackets.

\Makehead{Summary of Data Records}
\section{ Introduction }
 
{\tt GEANT} uses the {\tt FFREAD} \cite{bib-FFREAD}
package to read {\it free format} data records in the routine \Rind{GFFGO}.
The keywords accepted by \Rind{GFFGO} can be
classified as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item         general control of the run;
\item         control of the physics processes;
\item         debug and I/O operations;
\item         user applications;
\item         Lund event generation.
\end{enumerate}
 
The data records are listed below by category with the following information:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[KEY] keyword, any number of characters
truncated to the first 4 unless otherwise specified by the user;
\item[N] maximum expected number of variables ({\tt NVAR});
\item[T] type of these variables ({\tt I=INTEGER, R=REAL or M=MIXED})
and for each variable in turn:
\begin{itemize}
\item variable FORTRAN name;
\item short description (more detail in {\tt [BASE030]});
\item labelled common where it is stored;
\item default value, usually from \Rind{GINIT}.
\end{itemize}
\end{DLtt}
When a record is decoded, the values entered by the user
in free format are assigned to the variables in order.
The number of values can be less than {\tt NVAR}. In case of a {\tt MIXED}
type the values entered have agree
with the type of the corresponding variable.
 
For example the data record:
\begin{verbatim}
      RUNG   5   201
\end{verbatim}
presets the run and event number to 5 and 201 respectively.
None of the records mentioned below is mandatory.
\section{ User defined data records }
 
Before calling \Rind{GFFGO} the user may define private data records
through calls to \Rind{FFKEY} as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
     CALL FFKEY('key',VAR(1),NVAR,'type')
\end{verbatim}
They will be interpreted by \Rind{GFFGO} in the same way as the {\tt GEANT}
pre-defined records.

The scan geometry has been introduced in {\tt GEANT} version 3.15 with the
idea of developing a general parametrisation scheme. While the scan
geometry can already be built, the parametrisation scheme has not yet
been developed, so the following data records have to be considered as a

\section{The {\tt MA}ster {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem ({\tt MARS})}
 
The kinematic variables of the particles transporter by {\tt GEANT}
are always referred to the so-called 
{\tt MA}ster {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem ({\tt MARS}). This system
is implicitly defined as the local reference system of the first
volume defined, which contains all the others. This is a Cartesian
coordinate system with axis $\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z}$ where
$\hat{z} = \hat{x} \times \hat{y}$.
If the axes are labelled {\tt (X,Y,Z)}, then the point {\tt P}
is represented in fig \ref{fg:base090-1}.
 
\begin{figure}[hbt]
      \centering
      \epsfig{file=eps/base090-1.eps,width=10cm}
      \caption{{\tt GEANT} reference system}
      \label{fg:base090-1}
\end{figure}

Tracking is performed in the {\tt MARS} and the input position for
user routines such as the magnetic field routine is given in this
system.

\section{The local reference systems ({\tt MRS} and {\tt DRS})}
 
As explained in {\tt [GEOM001]}, the setup is
described via the definition of an initial volume inside which all
the others will be positioned. In {\tt GEANT} terminology, each time
a volume has contents, created either via division or by positioning 
other volumes inside, it is called a {\tt MOTHER}. The volumes contained
are called {\tt DAUGHTER}s, and they, in turn, can contain volumes to
a depth of 15 levels. This is sometimes referred to as a {\it Russian doll}
geometry.
 
Every volume defined in {\tt GEANT} has a reference system attached to
it (see {\tt GEOM} section). When this volume has contents, this
is referred to as the {\tt M}other {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem
({\tt MRS}, with origin in O$_m$). Daughters
are positioned inside the mother with respect to the {\tt MRS}. The 
{\tt MRS} of the first volume defined, containing all the others, is
nothing else than the {\tt MARS}.

Each one of the daughters has its own reference system, which is referred
to as the {\tt D}aughter {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem, or {\tt DRS} with
origin in O$_d$. 

The transformation of a point from the {\tt MRS} (V$_m$)
to the {\tt DRS} (V$_d$), at any level, is performed using a rotation 
matrix $[R]$ and a translation vector $T$ via the relation :
     \[ V_d  =[ R ](V_m -T) \]
The components of $T$ are the projections of the vector  $ (O_m, O_d) $
onto the {\tt MRS} axes.
The rotation matrices are computed from
the spherical angles of each of the axes of the
daughter reference systems ({\tt I, II, III})
with respect to the mother reference system ({\tt 1, 2, 3}).
The spherical angles $\Theta$ and $\Phi$ of a
direction $D$ are defined as follows :
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMM}
\item[$\Theta$]     is the angle formed by the axis 3 and D
                 ($0^{\circ}\;<\;\Theta\;<\;180^{\circ}$).
\item[$\Phi$]      is the angle formed by the axis 1 and the projection
                of D onto the plane defined by the axes 1 and 2
                 ($0^{\circ}\;<\;\Phi\;<\;360^{\circ}$).
\end{DLtt}
Examples are given in {\tt [GEOM200]}.
The various rotation matrices required for a given setup must be
defined by the user during the initialisation stage.
A number is assigned to each matrix {\tt [GEOM200]}.
The translation vector and the number of the rotation
matrix are specified by the user when the volumes are
positioned inside their mother {\tt [GEOM110]}.

\section{Physical units}
 
Unless otherwise specified, the following units are
used throughout the program:
centimeter, second, kilogauss, GeV, GeV c$^{-1}$ (momentum), 
GeV c$^{-2}$ (mass) and degree.

\section{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Whenever possible {\tt GEANT} makes use of the {\tt ZEBRA} store
for large data structures. This allows it to adapt the size of the program
data portion
to the size of the problem. The total amount of space required depends
on the application. {\tt GEANT} can run with as little as 50,000 words
or less, but for large detectors it is not uncommon to 
declare stores of several million words. The call to \Rind{GZEBRA}
initialises the common \FCind{/GCBANK/} to receive the {\tt GEANT}
data structures. This call is necessary before any other routine of
the {\tt GEANT} system is called.
\item The call to \Rind{HLIMIT} initialises the {\tt ZEBRA} system
to use the \FCind{/PAWC/} common block for the {\tt HBOOK} histogram
package. The size of the common depends on the number and size of the
plot requested. The {\tt ZEBRA} system must be initialised only once,
and the negative argument to \Rind{HLIMIT} prevents a second
initialisation of the system.
The \Rind{HLIMIT} call has to be placed {\bf after} the call
to \Rind{GZEBRA} and the argument has to be the dimension of the 
\FCind{/PAWC/} common block with a negative sign in front. 
\item
The main program is intended for {\it batch} applications,
while to run the simulation interactively, the interactive main program
called \Rind{GXINT} should be linked in front of the user code.
\item The program shown will require the graphic libraries in the
link sequence. Often, for batch production or for
small tests, graphics is not needed, and not loading the graphics
code makes the program smaller. To avoid loading graphic routines
the calls to \Rind{IGINIT}, \Rind{IGMETA}, \Rind{IGEND}, \Rind{GDINIT}
and \Rind{GDEBUG} should be removed. 

If, on the other hand, the user is interested in including the routine
\Rind{GDEBUG} and in excluding graphics at the same time, then the
following routine should be included in the code:
\begin{verbatim}
      SUBROUTINE GDCXYZ
      ENTRY IGSA
      ENTRY GDTRAK
      END
\end{verbatim}

which will avoid every reference to the graphics routines from \Rind{GDEBUG}.

\item The user code to define the {\it tracking media} and the geometry
of the setup should be inside the routine \Rind{UGEOM}. The pre-initialised
data structured can be read from disk, but it is recommended to call 
\Rind{GPHYSI} in any case, to initialise the cross-section tables. An 
example of a full material, geometry and detector design is given below
and has been extracted from the example {\tt GEXAM3}. Here only major
calls are shown, the redundant parts can be found in the source code
of \Rind{UGEOM} in {\tt GEXAM3}. 

The example shows the basic concept in 
{\tt GEANT}. First material parameters are defining the properities of
a detector material calling the subroutine \Rind{GSMATE}. 
Here in addition to the 16 predefined materials, the material definition of
Calcium is examplary shown. More information towards the predefined materials
and further use of material definition routines can be found in the 
section {\tt CONS001 - CONS101}.
Then tracking parameters are associated to the materials, defining
a so called tracking medium. Each {\tt GEANT}  volume must be 
associated to an existing tracking medium. Here in the example the
tracking medium {\tt 'TARGET'} is defined to exist of Calcium.
 
In the example shown below several
detector volumes are defined using the subroutine \Rind{GSVOLU}.
The defined volume have associated parameters of name, shape,
tracking medium and shape parameters.
In this example the volume {\tt 'TGT '} consists of the 
previously defined tracking medium {\tt 'TARGET'}.The 
volumes (and if necessary identical copies of them)
are then positioned according to the detector geometry. The 
volumes are positioned on the same level, or inside each other. By
setting the parameter {\tt ONLY} or  {\tt MANY} in the call of \Rind{GSPOS} 
the user has the opportunity to tell either {\tt GEANT} the logical
volume structure and to apply boolean operations (cutting, joining and
intersection) between two positioned volumes. More information about
the concept in defining volumes and positioning can be retrieved from
the section {\tt GEOM}. 

Finally the user is required to classify into sets all
sensitive detectors (defined as those volume defined as
detector via \Rind{GSDET} and other related routines, for which 
he wants to store hits in the hit data structure {\tt JHITS}.

\item It is convenient to store the input data records (see {\tt [BASE040]})
in an auxiliary file ({\tt gcards.dat} in the example). This allows to
have a standard input file and to overwrite selected input data records
as needed.
If, for instance, the standard {\tt gcards.dat} file contains the record
{\tt TRIG 1000} and a short test run is requested this can be obtained
with the following input:
\begin{verbatim}
READ 4
TRIG 10
STOP
\end{verbatim}
the first line instructs {\tt FFREAD} to open and process the file
connected with logical unit 4, and the second line (re-)defines the
number of events to be processed. The {\tt STOP} command ends the 
{\tt FFREAD} processing of the input.
\item 
In the above
example the common blocks have not been expanded in the code. The notation
used is the one of the {\tt PATCHY}/{\tt CMZ}~\cite{bib-PATCHY,bib-CMZ}
code management systems. These products, among other things, can
run as pre-processors, replacing the {\tt +SEQ,...}
instructions with the corresponding code fragments. Users are strongly
recommended to use these systems to include {\tt GEANT} common blocks
in their code. 

Long experience in supporting {\tt GEANT} users has shown that, as the
user program grows, typing errors in the insertion of the common blocks
{\it by hand} become very common, but difficult to find. The investment
needed to learn a code management system at the user level is usually 
negligible compared with the time and energy needed in hunting a
problem introduced by a mistyped common.

\Makehead{The system initialisation routines}
 
\Shubr{GZEBRA}{(NZ)}
 
Initialises the {\tt ZEBRA} memory manager to use the common \FCind{/GCBANK/}
to store the {\tt GEANT} data structures.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[NZ] ({\tt INTEGER}) size of the \FCind{/GCBANK/} common as it is
dimensioned in the main program.
\end{DLtt}
The size of the dynamic memory is set to {\tt NZ-30}. The common
\FCind{/GCBANK/} must be dimensioned in the main program.
{\tt ZEBRA}~\cite{bib-ZEBRA} must be initialised only once. The call to the
{\tt HBOOK} initialisation routine \Rind{HLIMIT} tries to initialise
{\tt ZEBRA} as well, and this will cause a program abort. To avoid this,
\Rind{HLIMIT} must be called {\bf after} \Rind{GZEBRA} and its argument
must be a negative number whose absolute value is the size of the
\FCind{/PAWC/} common containing the histograms. This is shown in the
example of main program given in {\tt[BASE100]}.

\Shubr{GINIT}{}
Presets labelled common block variables to default values.
See {\tt[BASE030]} for more information.

\Shubr{GFFGO}{}
Reads a set of data records via the {\tt FFREAD} package.
See {\tt[BASE040]} for more information on the possible data records.
\Rind{GFFGO} must be called after \Rind{GINIT}.

\Shubr{GZINIT}{}

Initialises the {\tt ZEBRA} permanent data structures in division
2 of the {\tt GEANT} main store in common  \FCind{/GCBANK/}.
Creates the user long term division (index {\tt IXCONS})
(minimum size {\tt 2000}, maximum size {\tt 8*NZEBRA/10}).
The {\tt ZEBRA} division {\tt IXDIV} is reserved for the event data structures
and the division {\tt IXCONS} for the initialisation data structures.
Allocates 5200 words of working space.
Initialises the link areas and a default run header bank {\tt JRUNG
[BASE299]}. Defines banks format for I/O.
\Rind{GZINIT} must be called after \Rind{GFFGO}.
 
A layout of the dynamic store is shown in fig \ref{fg:base110-1}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
      \centering
      \epsfig{file=eps/base110-1.eps,width=16cm}
      \caption{Layout of the dynamic store}
      \label{fg:base110-1}
\end{figure}

\Shubr{GDINIT}{}
This routine
initialises the {\tt GEANT} drawing package {\tt[DRAW001]} and it has
to be called before any other graphic routine. {\tt GEANT} uses the
CERN-developed {\tt HIGZ}~\cite{bib-HIGZ} graphic library, and this
has to be initialised before the call to \Rind{GDINIT}.
In the example given
in {\tt [BASE100]} the routines \Rind{IGINIT} and \Rind{IGMETA}
are used. Alternatively, the routine \Rind{HPLINT} from HPLOT~\cite{bib-HPLOT}
can be used. This routine calls the appropriate procedures from {\tt HIGZ} to 
initialise the underlaying graphics system. At the moment {\tt HIGZ} can 
use several flavours of GKS~\cite{bib-gks2d,bib-gks3d,bib-GKS1}
and {\tt X11} and it is available on all machines where the CERN Program
Library has been installed.

\Shubr{GPHYSI}{}
Completes the data structure {\tt JMATE}, (see {\tt [PHYS100]}) calculating the
cross-section and stopping power tables.

\Shubr{GBHSTA}{}
Initialises the standard histograms requested by the user via the
data record {\tt HSTA}.
The following histogram keywords may be used :
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[TIME]    time per event;
\item[SIZE]     size of division {\tt IXDIV} per event;
\item[MULT]    total number of tracks per event;
\item[NTRA]    number of {\it long life} tracks per event;
\item[STAK]    maximum stack size per event.
\end{DLtt}

\Rind{GBHSTA} should be called after \Rind{GFFGO}.

\Shubr{GGCLOS}{}
This routine has to be called at the end of the definition
of the geometry by the user, after thal all volumes have been defined
and positioned and all detectors defined. 
Failure to call this routine will prevent
the {\tt GEANT} system from working correctly. Main tasks of this routine
are:
\begin{itemize}
\item close the geometry package;
\item complete the {\tt JVOLUM} data structure;
\item process the detector definition provided by the user;
\item prepare the tables for the tracking speed optimisation requested
by the user via the \Rind{GSORD} routine or the {\tt OPTI} data record.
\end{itemize}

\item prints the sequence number, the event number and the random number
generator seeds,
under control of the flag {\tt ITEST} (data record {\tt DEBU}).

\Makehead{Debugging facilities}
The flags {\tt IDEBUG, ITEST} and {\tt ISWIT(1-10)} are available to
in the
common \FCind{/GCFLAG/} for debug control {\tt [BASE030]}.
The array {\tt ISWIT} is filled through the data record
{\tt SWIT}.
Some flags are used by \Rind{GHEISHA} {\tt [PHYS510]} and
by the routine \Rind{GDEBUG}.

The flag {\tt IDEBUG} is set to 1 in \Rind{GTRIGI} for the events
with sequence number from {\tt IDEMIN} to {\tt IDEMAX}, as specified by
the user on the data record {\tt DEBU}.
If {\tt IDEMIN} is negative, debug is
activated also in the initialisation phase.

The flag {\tt ITEST}, set by the user via the data
record {\tt DEBU}, is also used by \Rind{GTRIGI}.
The sequence number, the event number and the random numbers seeds are
printed at the beginning of each event every {\tt ITEST} from
{\tt IDEMIN} to {\tt IDEMAX}.

\section{Debug of data structures}
The contents of the data structures can be dumped by the routine
\Shubr{GPRINT}{(CHNAME,NUMB)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) name of a top level data structure;
\item[NUMB] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the substructure to be printed, 0 for all.
\end{DLtt}

Examples
\begin{itemize}
\item{\tt CALL GPRINT('KINE',0)} prints all banks {\tt JKINE};
\item{\tt CALL GPRINT('KINE',8)} prints {\tt JKINE} bank for track 8;
\item{\tt CALL GPRINT('VOLU',0)} prints all existing volumes.
\end{itemize}
The following names are recognised:
\begin{center}\tt
DIGI,HITS,KINE,MATE,VOLU,ROTM,SETS,TMED,PART,VERT,JXYZ
\end{center}
\Rind{GPRINT} calls selectively the routines:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\Rind{GPDIGI}{\tt ('*','*')} &
\Rind{GPHITS}{\tt ('*','*')} &
\Rind{GPKINE}{\tt (NUMB)}    & 
\Rind{GPMATE}{\tt (NUMB)}    \\
\Rind{GPVOLU}{\tt (NUMB)}    &
\Rind{GPROTM}{\tt (NUMB)}    &
\Rind{GPSETS}{\tt ('*','*')} &
\Rind{GPTMED}{\tt (NUMB)}    \\
\Rind{GPPART}{\tt (NUMB)}    &
\Rind{GPVERT}{\tt (NUMB)}    &
\Rind{GPJXYZ}{\tt (NUMB)}    &
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

These routines can be called directly by the user. In case of {\tt SETS},
{\tt HITS} and {\tt DIGI} the content of all detectors of all sets will
be printed, so {\tt NUMB} is irrelevant.

\section{Debug of events}
The development of an event can be followed via the routine:
\Shubr{GDEBUG}{}

which operates under the control of the {\tt ISWIT} array. It is the
user responsibility to call this routine from \Rind{GUSTEP}. If the
{\tt DEBUG} flag is active, the routine will perform as follows:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMM}
\item[ISWIT(1)] ~

\begin{DLtt}{MMM}
\item[2]the content of the temporary stack for secondaries in the
common \FCind{/GCKING/} is printed;
\end{DLtt}
\item[ISWIT(2)] ~

\begin{DLtt}{MMM}
\item[1]the current point of the track is stored in the {\tt JDXYZ}
bank via the routine \Rind{GSXYZ};
\item[2]the current information on the track is printed via the
routine \Rind{GPCXYZ};
\item[3]the current step is drawn via the routine
\Rind{GDCXYZ};
\item[4]the current point of the track is stored in the {\tt JDXYZ}
bank via the routine \Rind{GSXYZ}. When the particle stops the track
is drawn via the routine \Rind{GDTRAK}
and the space occupied by the track in the structure {\tt JDXYZ}
released;
\end{DLtt}
\item[ISWIT(3)] ~

\begin{DLtt}{MMM}
\item[1]the current point of the track is stored in the {\tt JDXYZ}
bank via the routine \Rind{GSXYZ}.
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}

\Shubr{GLOOK}{(CHNAME,IVECT,N,ILOOK*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME]({\tt CHARACTER*4}) variable containing the name to be
searched for in {\tt IVECT};
\item[IVECT] ({\tt INTEGER}) array containing the ASCII code of the 
names among which
{\tt NAME} is searched. The names are stored 4 characters per word;
\item[N]({\tt INTEGER}) number of items in {\tt IVECT};
\item[ILOOK]({\tt INTEGER}) position in {\tt IVECT} where {\tt NAME} has
been found, 0 if not found.
\end{DLtt}

This routine is very useful when searching for a string stored 
in a {\tt ZEBRA} bank. For instance to find the
position of the {\tt 'CRYS'} volume in the volume bank, the following
piece of code could be written:

\begin{verbatim}
+SEQ,GCBANK.
+SEQ,GCNUM.
      .
      .
      .
      CALL GLOOK('CRYS',IQ(JVOLUM+1),NVOLUM,IVO)
      IF(IVO.GT.0) THEN
         JVO = LQ(JVOLUM-IVO)
      ELSE
         JVO = 0
      ENDIF
\end{verbatim}

{\tt JVO}, if different from 0, is the pointer to the data
bank containing the information relative to the volume {\tt 'CRYS'}.

\Shubr{GEVKEV}{(EGEV,ENERU*,CHUNIT*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[EGEV] ({\tt REAL}) input, energy in GeV;
\item[ENERU] ({\tt REAL}) output, energy in the new unit;
\item[CHUNIT] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) unit in which the energy has been converted.
\end{DLtt}

This subroutine converts the input energy in GeV to a unit in which 
$1 \leq E \leq 999$. {\tt CHUNIT} contains the new
unit. The following piece of code illustrates the use of \Rind{GEVKEV}:
\begin{verbatim}
+SEQ,GCTRAK.
      CHARACTER*4 CHUNIT
      .
      .
      .
      CALL GEVKEV(DESTEP, DE, CHUNIT)
      WRITE(6,10000) DE, CHUNIT
10000 FORMAT(' The energy loss in this step is ',F7.2,A)
\end{verbatim}

\Shubr{GRNDM}{(VEC*,LEN)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[VEC] ({\tt REAL}) vector containing the generated random number;
\item[LEN] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of random numbers to generate.
\end{DLtt}

\Rind{GRNDM} generates a sequence of uniformly distributed random numbers in the
interval (0,1). The numbers are returned in a vector.
The code is a copy
of the CERN Program Library routine \Rind{RANECU}~\cite{bib-LECU,bib-JAM1} 
(entry V114).

Several independent sequences can be defined and used. Each sequence {\bf must}
be initialised by the user, otherwise the result is unpredictable. 
Two integer seeds are used to initialise a sequence. Not all pairs of
integers define a good random sequence or one which is independent from
others. Sections of the same random sequence can be defined as independent
sequences. The period of the generator is $2^{60} \approx 10^{18}$. 
A generation has
been performed in order to provide the seeds to start any of the generated
sections. There are 215 possible seed pairs and they are all $10{^9}$  numbers
apart. Thus a sequence started from one of the seed pairs, after $10{^9}$
numbers will start generating the next one. 

\Shubr{GRNDMQ}{(ISEED1,ISEED2,ISEQ,CHOPT)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[ISEED1] ({\tt INTEGER}) first seed of the sequence;
\item[ISEED2] ({\tt INTEGER}) second seed of the sequence;
\item[ISEQ] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the independent
sequence of random numbers referred to by this call. If
{\tt ISEQ}$\leq$0, then the last valid sequence used will be addressed
either for a save or a store. In case the option {\tt 'G'} is
specified, on output the variable will contain the sequence
actually used;
\item[CHOPT] ({\tt CHARACTER*1}) the action to be taken:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[' ']  if 1$\leq${\tt ISEQ}$\leq$215, sequence number {\tt ISEQ} will be
initialised with the seeds of the pre-computed
independent sequence {\tt ISEQ}.

If {\tt ISEQ}$\leq$0 or {\tt ISEQ}$>$215, sequence number 1 will be
initialised with the default seeds. {\tt ISEED1} and {\tt ISEED2} are
ignored;
\item['G']  get the present status of the generator: the two integer
seeds {\tt ISEED1} and {\tt ISEED2} will be returned for sequence
{\tt ISEQ};
\item['S']  set the status of the generator.
The two integer seeds {\tt ISEED1} and {\tt ISEED2} will be
used to restart the generator for sequence {\tt ISEQ}.
\item['SH']  the same action as for {\tt 'S'} and store the two
integer seeds {\tt ISEED1} and {\tt ISEED2} in the event header bank.
\item['Q']  Get the pre-generated seeds for {\tt ISEQ} 
(1$\leq${\tt ISEQ}$\leq$215).
There are 215 pre-generated sequences each one will
generate $10^{9}$  numbers before reproducing the following
one.
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}
 
Initialises the random number generator.
 
\Sfunc{GARNDM}{VALUE = GARNDM(DUMMY)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[DUMMY] ({\tt REAL}) dummy parameter, ignored;
\end{DLtt}

Returns a random number $r$ distributed as $e^{-x}$. $r = -\ln(\eta)$
where $\eta$ is a random number extracted by \Rind{GRNDM}.

\Shubr{GPOISS}{(AMVEC,NPVEC*,LEN)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[AMVEC] ({\tt REAL}) array of length {\tt LEN} containing the average
values of the Poisson distributions requested;
\item[NPVEC] ({\tt INTEGER}) array of length {\tt LEN} containing the random
numbers: {\tt NPVEC(I)} is a random number with a Poisson distribution of
average {\tt AMVEC(I)};
\item[LEN] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of random numbers requested.
\end{DLtt}

This routine extracts integer random numbers according to the
Poisson distribution. Given a Poisson distribution of average $\lambda \leq 16$
and $r$ uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, the method used is the 
following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item let $P = \exp(-\lambda)$, $N=0$ and $S=P$;
\item if $r\leq S$ accept $N$;
\item let $N=N+1$, $P=P \lambda/N$, $S=S+P$ and go back to 2;
\end{enumerate}

If $\lambda > 16$, a gaussian distribution with average $\lambda$ and 
$\sigma = \sqrt{\lambda}$ is generated.

\Makehead{Introduction to the section {\tt CONS}}
\section{Introduction}
 
The setup where the particles are transported is represented by a 
structure of geometrical volumes. Each volume is
filled with matter (which can have the properties of the vacuum in case
of it contains no matter).

The matter composing the volumes is described via
two sets of attributes. The first set is relative to the nature
of the {\it material} composing the volume, and contains information
such as the atomic number, the atomic weight, the density and so on
(see the description of the routine \Rind{GSMATE} in this section for
more information). 

The second set of attributes is relevant to the
process of particle transport 
and they define a so-called {\it tracking medium}. These are
parameters such as the material composing the volume,
the magnetic field, the required tracking precision,
the maximum energy that can be lost in one step and so on (see the
description of the routine \Rind{GSTMED} in this section for more
information).

Each tracking medium refers to a material via a {\it material
number} which is assigned by the user. Different tracking media can, with
some limitation, refer to the same material.

Each volume is filled by a tracking medium identified by 
a {\it medium number}.
Different volumes may have the same medium number (see {\tt [GEOM]}).
 
The transport of particles through a
setup ({\tt [TRAK]}) requires access to
data which describe:
\begin{itemize}
\item   the geometry of the setup;
\item   the {\it material} and {\it tracking medium} parameters;
\item   the particle properties.
\end{itemize}
The section {\tt [CONS]} contains the routines
for the storage and retrieval of information related to materials,
tracking media and the particles.

{\bf Important note:} many entities in {\tt GEANT} are user-defined
via a subroutine call. One of the arguments of this subroutine is 
a integer number which identifies the entity. Examples are materials,
tracking media, particles and so on. It can be tempting, for booking
purposes, to use very large numbers. For instance, in a large detector,
the number of all the materials in the hadronic calorimeter could be
$1001 \leq I \leq 2000$. Even if these conventions are very handy, they
can introduce a performance penalty.

For reasons of speed, the number provided by the user is used directly
as the number of the link in the {\tt ZEBRA} data structure indicating
where to store the pointer to
the bank containing the information on the entity. {\tt ZEBRA} 
pointers are contiguous. Defining an object with a user number of $1000$
forces {\tt ZEBRA} to allow space for $1000$ links. This entails a loss
of space ($999$ words), but much worse than that, induces {\tt ZEBRA} to
believe that there are in fact $999$ more banks. At every operation which 
causes a {\it relocation} of banks, {\tt ZEBRA} will check all the possible 
links, which can be very time consuming.

So values of user-defined entities must be kept as small as possible and
contiguous. In large applications one could write a routine which returns
the next free number to be allocated, which can then be stored in a variable
and always referenced symbolically, freeing the user from the need to define
ranges. As an example we give here a function performing this operation
for the material number:
\begin{verbatim}
      FUNCTION NEXTMA()
+SEQ, GCBANK
      IF(JMATE.LE.0) THEN
         NEXTMA = 1
      ELSE
         DO 10 IMAT = 1, IQ(JMATE-2)
            IF(LQ(JMATE-IMAT).EQ.0) GOTO 20
  10     CONTINUE
  20     NEXTMA = IMAT
      ENDIF
      END
\end{verbatim}

\section{Materials}
The material constants are stored in the data structure {\tt JMATE} via the 
routine \Rind{GSMATE} and can be retrieved via the routine \Rind{GFMATE} and 
printed via the routine \Rind{GPMATE}. The routine \Rind{GMATE} calls
repeatedly the routine \Rind{GSMATE} to define a standard set of materials, 
but its use is not mandatory. Mixtures of basic materials, compounds or
molecules with atoms
from different basic materials, may also be defined and their characteristics
are stored in the structure {\tt JMATE}, through calls to the routine
\Rind{GSMIXT}. Mixtures of compounds are allowed.

Quantities such as energy loss and cross-section tables (see {\tt [PHYS]}),
computed during the initialisation of the program are stored in the 
structure {\tt JMATE}. These can be accessed through the routine \Rind{GFTMAT}
and plotted or printed through the routines \Rind{GPLMAT} and \Rind{GPRMAT} 
respectively.

\section{Tracking media}
 
The tracking medium
parameters are stored in the data
structure {\tt JTMED} by the routine \Rind{GSTMED}. Details
about these parameters are given
in {\tt [TRAK]}. They can be accessed with the routine
\Rind{GFTMED} and printed with the routine \Rind{GPTMED}.

The correctness of the transport process and thus the reliability
of the results obtained with {\tt GEANT} depend critically on the
values of the {\it tracking medium parameters}. To help the user,
most of the parameters are recalculated by default by {\tt GEANT}
irrespective of the value assigned by the user. Advanced users
can control the value of the parameters thus bypassing the automatic
computation. See the description of the routine \Rind{GSTMED} for
more information.

The tracking thresholds, and other parameters and flags that control
the physics processes, defined in \Rind{GINIT} and possibly
modified through the relevant data records, are also stored in the structure
{\tt JTMED}. These parameters can be redefined for each tracking medium
via the routine \Rind{GSTPAR}.

\section{Particles}
The parameters of the particles transported by {\tt GEANT}
are stored in the data structure
{\tt JPART} via the routine \Rind{GSPART}. 
The decay properties of particles are defined via the routine \Rind{GSDK}.
The particle constants can be
accessed with the routine \Rind{GFPART} and printed with the routine
\Rind{GPPART}.

The routine \Rind{GPART} defines the standard table of particles,
branching ratios and decay modes. This routine needs to be called for 
the {\tt GEANT} system to work properly. 
\Rind{GPART} calls the routine \Rind{GSPART} for the
particle properties and \Rind{GSDK} for the decays for
each particle in the standard {\tt GEANT} table. 
The user may call \Rind{GSPART} and
\Rind{GSDK} to extend or modify the table defined by \Rind {GPART}.

from $10^{-5}$ GeV (10 keV) to $10^{4}$ GeV (10 TeV) equally spaced on
logarithmic scale. This can be controlled by the user via the data
record or the interactive command {\tt ERAN} ({\tt [BASE040]}).
{\tt ELOW} can be used as the input argument {\tt TKIN}, e.g.:
\begin{verbatim}
CALL GFTMAT (10, 1,'PHOT',NEK1, ELOW ,VALUE, PCUT, IXST)
\end{verbatim}

\Makehead{Mixtures and Compounds}
\Shubr{GSMIXT}{(IMATE,NAMATE,A,Z,DENS,NLMAT,WMAT*)}
 
Defines mixture or compound {\tt IMATE} as composed by
{\tt NLMAT} materials defined via
the arrays {\tt A}, {\tt Z} and {\tt WMAT}.
Mixtures of compounds can also be defined.
 
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[IMATE]({\tt INTEGER}) user material (mixture) number;
\item[NAMATE]({\tt CHARACTER*20}) mixture name;
\item[A]({\tt REAL}) array of atomic weights;
\item[Z]({\tt REAL}) array of atomic numbers;
\item[DENS]({\tt REAL}) density in g cm$^{-3}$;
\item[NLMAT]({\tt INTEGER}) number of elements in the mixture;
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMM}
\item[$> 0$]{\tt WMAT} contains the proportion
by weights of each material in the mixture;
\item[$< 0$]{\tt WMAT} contains the proportion by number of
atoms of each kind, the content of {\tt WMAT} in output is
changed to contain the relative weights;
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}
 
\subsection*{Method}
For a compound ({\tt NLMAT} $< 0$), the {\it molecular} weight and charge are:
\[
A_{mol} = \sum_i n_i A_i\mbox{\hspace{3cm}} Z_{mol} = \sum_i n_i Z_i
\]
where $n_i$ {\tt = WMAT(I)} is the number of atoms of the i$^{th}$
component of the molecule. In this case the proportion by weight is:
\[
 p_i = \frac{n_i A_i}{A_{mol}}
\]
where $p_i$ {\tt = WMAT(I)} in output.
From the relative weights,
\Rind{GSMIXT} works out the effective atomic weight and atomic number
according to the following formulas:
\[
A_{eff} = \sum_i p_i A_i \mbox{\hspace{3cm}}   Z_{eff} = \sum_i p_i Z_i
\]
which are stored in the {\tt JMATE} data structure {\tt [CONS199]}
together with the radiation length.
 
The radiation length is computed according to the EGS
manual \cite{bib-EGS3}, formula 268 (37), for an element:
\[
\frac{1} {\rho \: X_0 }=4 \alpha r_{0}^2 N_{Av}  \frac{1}{A}
     Z(Z+ \xi (Z)) \left[ \ln \frac{183}{Z^{1/3}}
      -F_c (Z) \right]
\]
where
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[$X_0$]   radiation length (in cm);
\item[$\rho$] density (in g cm$^{-3}$);
\item[$\alpha$] fine structure constant;
\item[$r$]classical electron radius (in cm);
\item[$N_{Av}$] Avogadro's number;
\item[$A$]atomic weight;
\item[$Z$]atomic number;
\item[$F_c(Z)$] Coulomb correction function.
\end{DLtt}
\[
F_c (Z) = (\alpha Z)^2 \left[ \frac{1}
     { 1+( \alpha Z)^2}  +0.20206-0.0369( \alpha Z)^2
      +0.0083(\alpha Z)^4 -0.0020(\alpha Z)^6 \right]
\]
\[
\xi (Z) = \frac{\ln \frac{1440}{Z^{2/3}}}
        {\ln \frac{183}{Z^{1/3}} - F_c (Z)}
\]
for a compound or mixture:
\[
 \frac{1}{\rho X_0}=\sum_i \frac{p_i}{\rho_i X_{0i}}
\]
where $p_i$ is the proportion by weight of the i$^{th}$ element.
For more information on the organisation of the data in memory
see {\tt [CONS199]}.

The effective absorption length $\lambda$ is defined as
the interaction length of a 5GeV pion in the material:
\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = \sum_i \frac{p_i}{\lambda_i}
\hspace{2cm} \frac{1}{\lambda_i} = \frac{\sigma^{\pi}_{i}(5GeV)
 N_{Av}}{A_{i}} 
\hspace{0.5cm} \mbox{g$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$}
\]
Once this value has been determined, an effective hadronic atomic weight 
($A_{h-eff}$) is calculated by the routine \Rind{GHMIX} \cite{bib-GHMI}
and stored in the data structure.

The values are computed for a proton (mass Mp). For any other
particle with mass M and kinetic energy T,
one has to compute the equivalent proton kinetic energy as T*Mp/M
and look at the corresponding energy binning [PHYS 430].

\section*{Description of the routines}
\Shubr{GSTMED}{(ITMED,NATMED,NMAT,ISVOL,IFIELD,FIELDM,TMAXFD,STEMAX,
                DEEMAX,EPSIL,STMIN,UBUF,NWBUF)}
This routine associates a set of tracking parameters to a material, defining
a so-called {\it tracking medium}. Every {\tt GEANT} volume must be 
associated to an existing tracking medium. The routine
stores the parameters of the tracking
medium {\tt ITMED} in the data structure {\tt JTMED}.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[ITMED]      ({\tt INTEGER}) tracking medium number;
\item[NATMED]     ({\tt CHARACTER*20}) tracking medium name;
\item[NMAT]       ({\tt INTEGER}) material number corresponding to {\tt ITMED};
\item[ISVOL]      ({\tt INTEGER}) {\it sensitivity} flag (see later):
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[$\leq$0] not a sensitive volume;
\item[$>$0] sensitive volume;
\end{DLtt}
\item[IFIELD]     ({\tt INTEGER}) magnetic field flag:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[=0]         no magnetic field;
\item[=1]         strongly 
inhomogeneous magnetic field (returned by the user function
\Rind{GUFLD}): tracking performed with the Runge-Kutta method by the
routine \Rind{GRKUTA};
\item[=2]         inhomogeneous magnetic field (returned by the user function
\Rind{GUFLD}), tracking along a helix performed by the routine \Rind{GHELIX};
\item[=3]         uniform magnetic field along the {\tt z} axis of strength
{\tt FIELDM}, tracking performed along a helix by the routine \Rind{GHELX3};
\end{DLtt}
\item[FIELDM]     ({\tt REAL}) maximum field value (in Kilogauss);
\item[TMAXFD]     ({\tt REAL}) maximum angular deviation due to the magnetic
field permitted in one step (in degrees);
\item[STEMAX]     ({\tt REAL}) maximum step permitted (cm);
\item[DEEMAX]     ({\tt REAL}) maximum fractional energy loss in one step ($0<$
                  {\tt DEEMAX} $\leq 1$);
\item[EPSIL]      ({\tt REAL}) boundary crossing precision (cm);
\item[STMIN]      ({\tt REAL}) minimum value for the maximum step imposed by 
energy loss, multiple scattering, \v{C}erenkov or magnetic field effects (cm);
\item[UBUF]       ({\tt REAL}) array of {\tt NWBUF} additional user parameters;
\item[NWBUF]      ({\tt INTEGER}) number of additional user parameters.
\end{DLtt}
 
{\bf Note:} the tracking medium number can in principle be any positive
integer from 1 to 65,535. However this number is used directly by {\tt GEANT}
as the number of the pointer to the data structure where the information
is stored. When a pointer is defined,
all pointers from 1 to the one allocated are created, if not already existing.
Every time data structures are moved in memory, all the
links are potentially scanned for update. This can be time consuming and
it can seriously affect performances. So a continuous
range of numbers should be used for tracking media.

\Shubr{GFTMED}{(ITMED,NATMED*,NMAT*,ISVOL*,IFIELD*,FIELDM*,TMAXFD*,
                STEMAX*,DEEMAX*,EPSIL*,STMIN*,UBUF*,NWBUF*)}
 
Extracts the parameters of the tracking medium {\tt ITMED}
from the data structure {\tt JTMED}.
 
\Shubr{GPTMED}{(ITMED)}
 
Prints the tracking medium parameters for the given medium.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMM}
\item[ITMED]      ({\tt INTEGER}) tracking medium to be printed,
all tracking media if {\tt ITMED}=0.
\end{DLtt}

\section*{Automatic calculation of the tracking parameters}

The results of the simulation depend critically on the choice of the tracking
medium parameters. To make of {\tt GEANT} a reliable and consistent predictive
tool, the calculation of these parameters has been automated.
In a normal GEANT run, the variable {\tt IGAUTO} in common
\FCind{/GCTRAK/} is set to 1. In this case the following parameters 
are calculated by the program:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{\tt TMAXFD} & = & \left\{
\begin{array}{LL}
20^{\circ} & \mbox{if {\tt TMAXFD} $\leq 0$ or {\tt TMAXFD} $ > 20$} \\
\mbox{\it input value} & \mbox{if $0 <$ {\tt TMAXFD} $\leq 20$}
\end{array} \right . \\
\mbox{\tt STEMAX} & = & \phantom{\{} 
\begin{array}{LL} \mbox{\tt BIG} (=10^{10}) \end{array} \\
\mbox{\tt DEEMAX} & = & \left \{
\begin{array}{LL}
0.25 & \parbox[t]{10cm}{if {\tt ISVOL} $= 0$ and $X_{0} \leq 2cm$, 
where $X_{0}$ is the radiation length of the material} \\
0.25-\frac{0.2}{\sqrt{X_{0}}} & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array} \right . \\
\mbox{\tt STMIN} & = & \left\{
\begin{array}{LL}
\frac{2 R}{\sqrt{X_{0}}} & \mbox{if {\tt ISVOL} $=0$} \\ [.2cm]
\frac{5 R}{\sqrt{X_{0}}} & \mbox{if {\tt ISVOL} $\neq 0$}
\end{array} \right . 
\end{eqnarray*}

where $R$ is the range in cm of an electron of energy {\tt CUTELE}+200keV.

If the {\tt IGAUTO} variable is set to 0 via the {\tt AUTO} data record, 
then value given by the user for the above parameters is accepted as the
true parameter value if $>0$, while automatic calculation still takes place
in case the input value is negative.

Users are strongly recommended to begin their simulation with the parameters
as calculated by {\tt GEANT}. Users who want to modify any of the above
parameters must be sure they understand their function in the program and
the implications of a change.

The {\tt EPSIL} parameter represents the absolute precision with which the
tracking is performed. It has a double meaning. When tracking in magnetic
field, {\tt EPSIL} is the minimum distance for which boundaries are
checked. A particle nearer than {\tt EPSIL} to the boundary is considered
as exiting the current volume. If the end point of the step of a particle in
magnetic field is distant less than {\tt EPSIL} along each axis 
from what would be the end point in absence of magnetic field, then no boundary 
checking is performed. 

In all cases, when a particle is going to reach the
boundary of the current volume with the current step, the step length is 
increased by a quantity ({\tt PREC}, common \FCind{/GCTMED/}) which is set to the 
minimum between $0.1 \times {\tt EPSIL}$
and 10 micron at the beginning of the tracking. This quantity is recalculated
at every step according to the formula:
\begin{equation}
\mbox{\tt PREC} 
=\max \left [ \min \left(\frac{\mbox{\tt EPSIL}}{10}, 10 \mu \right ) ,
\max \left [ | x |, | y |, | z |, S \right ) \times \epsilon \right ]
\end{equation}
Where $x, y, z$ are the current coordinates of the particle, $S$ is the length
of the track, and $\epsilon$ is the assumed machine precision.
$\epsilon$ (called {\tt EPSMAC} in the program) is initially set to
$10^{-6}$ for 32 bits machines and $10^{-11}$ for 64 bits machines.
During the tracking, every fifth time that a particle tries unsuccessfully
to exit from the same volume, the machine precision is multiplied by the
number of trials. This accounts for additional losses of precision due to
transformation of coordinates and region of the floating point range where
the real machine precision is different from the above (this happens 
in particular on IBM mainframes with 370 floating point number representation).

The data structure {\tt JTMED} contains the standard tracking parameters
({\tt CUTS} and flags to control the physics processes) which are used by
default for all tracking media. It is possible to redefine individually
with \Rind{GSTPAR} any of these parameters for a given tracking medium.
For example to change {\tt CUTGAM} to 0.0001 for tracking medium {\tt ITMED}:
\begin{center}
 {\tt CALL GSTPAR(ITMED,'CUTGAM',0.0001)}
\end{center}

For more information on default values for {\tt IDRAY} and {\tt ILOSS} see
{\tt [BASE040]}.
 
The default tracking medium parameters are stored in the bank whose
pointer is stored in the {\tt JTMED} variable. In this case in the
above table {\tt JTMN} = {\tt JTMED}. In the case one or more of
the above parameters has been modified for a specific tracking
medium, the whole parameter set is stored in the next bank of the
given trackin medium. In this case {\tt JTMN} = {\tt LQ(JTM)} in
the above table, where {\tt JTM} is the pointer to the bank of the
tracking medium, i.e. {\tt JTM} = {\tt LQ(JTMED-ITMED)}.
 
{\bf Note}
 
At tracking time the parameters above are copied
from {\tt JTMN} into the common blocks
\FCind{/GCCUTS/} and \FCind{/GCPHYS/}. \Rind{GSTPAR} must be called before
\Rind{GPHYSI}.

{\bf Note}
 
It is possible for the user to define more particles or to redefine
some characteristics of the particles currently defined in {\tt GEANT},
but this must be done with extreme care. In particular, the mass and
charge of most particles are stored independently in {\tt FLUKA}, and
any change made via \Rind{GSPART} will not affect these values. Removing
particles from the list can lead to unpredictable results and it is
strongly discouraged.
 
The user who needs 
more particles, or wants to partly override the standard values,
can do that via the routines \Rind{GSPART} and \Rind{GSDK}.

\Submitted{23.01.84}     \Revised{08.12.93}
\Makehead {Branching Ratios and Particle Decay Modes}
\Shubr{GSDK}{(IPART,BRATIO,MODE)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[IPART]       ({\tt INTEGER}) {\tt GEANT} particle number;
\item[BRATIO]   ({\tt REAL}) array of branching ratios in \%,
maximum 6;
\item[MODE]     ({\tt INTEGER}) array of partial decay modes.
\end{DLtt}
\Rind{GSDK} stores the branching ratios and partial decay modes for two
and three body particle decays into the data structure {\tt JPART}.
The decay modes should be coded into the array {\tt MODE} such that:
\begin{center}
{\tt MODE(I) =  10$^4$ N3 + 10$^2$ N2 + N1} \hspace{2cm}
for {\tt I=1,$\cdots$,6}
\end{center}
where:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item [N1]     particle number for decay product 1;
\item [N2]     particle number for decay product 2;
\item [N3]     particle number for decay product 3 (if any).
\end{DLtt}
It is important to note the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item  prior to calling \Rind{GSDK}, all parent and secondary particles should
have been defined by \Rind{GSPART};
\item  if less than six decay modes are defined the remaining elements
of {\tt BRATIO} and {\tt MODE} must be set to zero.
\end{itemize}
For a given particle, {\tt IPART}, the decay parameters are stored into
the {\tt JPART} data structure as follows:

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[JPA] {\tt = LQ(JPART-IPART)} pointer to the bank containing the
information on the particle {\tt IPART};
\item[JDK1] {\tt = LQ(JPA-1)} pointer to branching ratios bank;
 \item[JDK2] {\tt = LQ(JPA-2)} pointer to decay modes bank;
\item[BR(I)] {\tt = Q(JDK1+I)}     I$^{th}$ branching ratio;
 \item[MODE(I)] {\tt = IQ(JDK2+I)}   I$^{th}$ decay mode, where
{\tt I=1,$\cdots$,6}.
\end{DLtt}
When a particle decays during tracking,
the routine \Rind{GDECAY} is called. If branching ratios and modes
have been stored by \Rind{GSDK}, then \Rind{GDECAY}
generates the decay products in the 2- or 3-body phase space.
If no branching ratios have been defined by \Rind{GSDK},
the user routine
\Rind{GUDCAY} is called, where the user can code special decay modes and
branching ratios. All data taken from Aguilar Benitez \cite{bib-AGUI}.

\Submitted{07.03.92}  \Revised {11.12.92}
\Makehead{Introduction to  the Drawing  package}
\section {The drawing package }
The drawing package has been designed mainly to visualise:
\begin {itemize}
\item  detector components;
\item  the logical tree of detector components;
\item  the geometrical dimensions;
\item  particle trajectories
\item  the hits recorded in the sensitive elements of the detector.
\end{itemize}
\section{Graphics in {\tt GEANT}}

The set of routines in the drawing package
allows the visualisation of the volumes of the detector.
These routines can be called from the user program or interactively via
the command interface. The output can be directed onto the screen or to a 
file. The graphics of {\tt GEANT} is based on the 
{\tt HIGZ}~\cite{bib-HIGZ} package. 
\index{HIGZ}%
{\tt HIGZ} is a high-level interface between the user program (in this
case {\tt GEANT}), {\tt ZEBRA} and a basic graphics library.
At the moment of writing, {\tt HIGZ} can use various flavours
of the {\tt GKS}~\notHTML{\cite{bib-gks2d,bib-gks3d,bib-GKS1}}%
                 \HTML{\cite{bib-gks2d}, \cite{bib-gks3d}, \cite{bib-GKS1}}
graphics system or the {\tt X11}\cite{bib-X11} system. A version based on
the {\tt PHIGS}\cite{bib-phigs} system is now being developed at CERN.

\section{Graphics functionality of {\tt GEANT}}
The graphics capabilities of {\tt GEANT} have been greatly enhanced in 
the last few revisions of the program. It is now possible to display 
volumes with
hidden lines removed from the drawing. This improves the understanding of
complicated objects. It is also possible to {\it cut} the displayed volumes
with various shapes (boxes, cones, tubes and spheres) in order
to visualise the internals of a detector element.
The surfaces of the volumes drawn can be filled with
colour, either solid or shaded according to a scan-line based
lighting algorithm. 
A more sophisticated surface rendering algorithm is now being developed
but it will be available only in the next version of the program.

Almost all drawing commands can be executed either by
calling a routine from the
user application or by
issuing a command when running {\tt GEANT} with the
standard interactive interface. 
Several interactive
tools ({\tt ZOOM}, {\tt LENS}) have been developed to analyse in detail 
the various parts of the detectors.
The interactive {\tt MOVE} facility allows the rotation, 
translation and zooming
in real time for simple components of the detectors.
Some of these commands are only available in the
interactive interface. These are described briefly in {\tt [DRAW500]} and
more extensively in the {\tt [XINT]} section.

A user interface based on X-Windows and Motif is also available
mainly on Unix workstations. Details of this interface are described
in {\tt [DRAW510]}.

Various graphical options can be set via the \Rind{GSATT} and \Rind{GDOPT} 
routines.

Every detector component can be visualised either in orthonormal projection
or in perspective (routines \Rind{GDRAW} and \Rind{GDRVOL}). Sections of the 
volumes and of their descendents can be visualised as well (routines 
\Rind{GDRAWX} and \Rind{GDRAWC}). 

The hierarchical relations of the various volumes which compose the
detector can be visualised via the \Rind{GDTREE} routine. In the 
interactive interface the user can select one of the volumes which
are nodes of the tree with the mouse,
and display the characteristics of the volume and walk up and down
the logical tree.

Tracks and hits can be drawn either alone or superimposed on the detector
(routines \Rind{GDCHIT}, \Rind{GDHITS}, \Rind{GDAHIT}, \Rind{GDXYZ}). It is also possible to 
draw the tracks while tracking is performed via the routine \Rind{GDCXYZ}. 

The drawing may be done with hidden-line removal
and with shading effects according to the value of the options {\tt HIDE}
and {\tt SHAD} (see next section).

Drawing complicated detectors can be a lengthy process even on a fast machine.
In particular,
when graphics options like hidden line removal or surface shading
are requested and many volumes are involved, the complete drawing can take
several minutes on the most powerful workstations. To alleviate this problem
drawings can be stored in memory in so called {\it view banks}. The routines
involved are \Rind{GDOPEN}, \Rind{GDCLOS}, \Rind{GDSHOW} and \Rind{GDELET}, 
and the corresponding interactive commands ({\tt DOPEN, DCLOSE, DSHOW, 
DELETE}). These banks can then be redisplayed quickly. They can also be 
written on disk and read back.

Attributes like colour (\Rind{GDCOL}) and line width (\Rind{GDLW}) can be
globally set for all 2D drawings (i.e. text, vectors, man, etc.);
such attributes do not affect the volume attributes that can be set by
the \Rind{GSATT} routine with {\tt COLO} or {\tt LWID} option.

The user can control some drawing options (\Rind{GDOPT}), by selecting,
for instance, to have either parallel or perspective projection,
either {\tt Y-Z} or {\tt R-Z} projection, etc.
 
The geometrical dimensions of an existing volume can be changed via the
routine \Rind{GEDITV}.
 
Various service routines allow the drawing of the 
profile of a human figure, the
axis, the scale of the dimension of the drawing and so on. These are 
described in {\tt [DRAW400]}.

\section{The shading algorithm}
In {\tt GEANT 3.16} a new shading algorithm has been introduced which
is 10 to 100 times faster than the algorithm which was implemented in
{\tt GEANT 3.15}. In the new algorithm the search for the visible portions
of all the faces of every volume is performed in the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the vertices of each face are transformed from the {\tt MARS} to
the screen reference system. In this way the dimensions of the face are
of the order of magnitude of centimeters.
\item in the screen reference system the face is {\it filled} with
horizontal lines {\it scan-lines} according to the desired resolution.
\item These lines are then transformed back in the {\tt MARS}, where the
hidden line removal technique is used to find their visible portions.
\item The colour luminosity is chosen as a function of the angle between
the normal to the surface and the line of view which is considered to be
also the line of illumination.
\item The visible portions of the lines are finally transformed into the
screen reference system and drawn with the calculated luminosity so that
they fill only the visible part of each face.
\end{enumerate}
The resulting picture can be saved into {\tt GEANT} view banks or {\tt HIGZ}
picture files.
 
\section{ Summary}
 
The best way to initialise the drawing package is to call the 
{\tt HPLOT}~\cite{bib-HPLOT}
initialisation routine \Rind{HPLINT}. This will work independently of the 
basic graphic package used. The reader should consult the {\tt HPLOT}
documentation for more information on this routine.
The drawing package is initialised by:

                     opened, and restore screen mode

\Submitted{10.03.94}
\Revised{10.03.1994}  
\Makehead{The Ray-tracing package}

Running interactively under X11, a new visualization tool is provided in
{\tt GEANT} 3.21: the ray-tracing package. Based on the new 
{\tt GEANT} tracking (see
{\tt GEOM} and {\tt TRACK}), 
a set of routines doing light processing is provided to
visualize the detectors (useful also to visualize the results of boolean
operations).
Basically, visible light particles are tracked
throughout the detector until when they do not hit the surface of a volume
declared not transparent; then, the intersection point is transformed to 
the screen coordinates and the corresponding pixel is drawn with a computed 
hue and luminosity. 


In case the command ({\tt DOPT RAYT ON}) is executed,
the drawings are performed by the {\tt GEANT} ray-tracing;
automatically, the color is assigned according to the tracking medium of each
volume and the volumes with a density lower/equal than the air are considered
transparent; if the option ({\tt USER}) is set ({\tt ON}) 
(again via the command ({\tt DOPT})),
the user can set color and visibility for the desired volumes via the command
({\tt SATT}), as usual, relatively to the attributes ({\tt COLO}) and 
({\tt SEEN}).
The resolution can be set via the command 
({\tt SATT * FILL VALUE}), where ({\tt VALUE})
is the ratio between the number of pixels drawn and 20 (user coordinates).
Parallel view and perspective view are possible 
({\tt DOPT PROJ PARA/PERS}).

In the
first case, we assume that the first mother volume of the tree is a box with
dimensions 10000 X 10000 X 10000 cm and the view point (infinetely far) is
5000 cm far from the origin along the Z axis of the user coordinates; in the
second case, the distance between the observer and the origin of the world
reference system is set in cm by the command 
({\tt PERSP NAME VALUE}). 
Grand-angle
or telescopic effects can be achieved changing the scale factors in the command
({\tt DRAW}). 
(Please, note that in case of perspective views, fixed the distance of 
the viewer, the zooming factors for the raytracing option must be 8.25 times
bigger than the ones used for the {\tt HIDE} options in order to get the same
picture).
When the final picture does not occupy the full window,
mapping the space before tracing can speed up the drawing, but can also
produce less precise results; values from 1 to 4 are allowed in the command
({\tt DOPT MAPP VALUE}), 
the mapping being more precise for increasing ({\tt VALUE}). For
({\tt VALUE} = 0) 
no mapping is performed (therefore max precision and lowest speed).

The command ({\tt VALCUT}) allows the cutting of the detector by three planes
ortogonal to the x,y,z axis. The attribute ({\tt LSTY}) can be set 
by the command
{\tt SATT} for any desired volume and can assume values from 0 to 7. 
It determines
the different light processing to be performed for different materials:
0 = dark-matt, 1 = bright-matt, 2 = plastic, 3 = ceramic, 4 = rough-metals,
5 = shiny-metals, 6 = glass, 7 = mirror. 


The detector is assumed to be in the
dark, the ambient light luminosity is 0.2 for each basic hue (the saturation
is 0.9) and the observer is assumed to have a light source (therefore he will
produce parallel light in the case of parallel view and point-like-source
light in the case of perspective view). Finally, a second light source can 
be positioned in the space (with a desired intensity) via the command 
({\tt SPOT}).

\Makehead{Drawing a Volume -- Case 1}
 
\Shubr{GDRAW}{(CHNAME,THETA,PHI,PSI,U0,V0,SU,SV)}
Draws an orthographic parallel projection or
a perspective projection 
of volume {\tt CHNAME} according to the options set via the 
routine \Rind{GDOPT} and all its {\it visible} descendants
(see routine \Rind{GSATT} to alter the visibility of a volume)
at position {\tt U0,V0} (user coordinates), with the scale
factors {\tt SU} and {\tt SV};
the object is seen from {\tt THETA} and {\tt PHI} angles, and
the resulting 2D projection is rotated
by an angle {\tt PSI} on the screen plane.
These parameters, as well as zoom parameters set by \Rind{GDZOOM}
define the current {\it view parameters}, and they are copied
in the common \FCind{/GCDRAW/}. Attributes like colour, surface fill,
line width, line style, visibility, etc. can be set by calling 
the \Rind{GSATT} routine for {\tt CHNAME} and its descendants 
{\tt [GEOM 500]}. An example of the result of the call:

\begin{center}
{\tt CALL GDRAW('ARM ',40.,40.,0.,nx,ny,0.015,0.015) }
\end{center}

is given in fig~\ref{draw110-1} for various values of the attributes
and graphic options.

\end{figure}

Drawing with hidden line removal and surface fill shading is also possible, 
but the drawing time may increase substantially for complicated 
objects.

When using the interactive interface it is possible to {\it cut}
the object to be drawn with {\it cutting} volumes (command {\tt CVOL}).
This is particularly
useful to visualise the contents of an object drawn with hidden line removal.
Another feature which is available only interactively is the possibility
to draw each decendant of a volume shifted along the axis which goes from the
centre of the local coordinate system to the centre of gravity of
the descendant itself. This again is useful to improve the visibility of the
details of a complicated setup (command {\tt BOMB}). Please see the interactive
interface description for more information on this part.

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMM}

\Shubr{GDRVOL}{(NNAMS,CHNAMS,LNUMBS,NRS,THETA,PHI,PSI,U0,V0,SU,SV)}
Draws an orthographic parallel projection or a perspective projection 
(depending on the option chosen via \Rind{GDOPT}) of the volume 
{\tt CHNAMS(N),LNUMBS(N)} with all its descendants, at the position 
{\tt U0,V0} (user coordinates), with the scale factors {\tt SU} and 
{\tt SV}. 
The object is seen from {\tt THETA} and {\tt PHI} angles, 
and the resulting 2D projection is also rotated by an angle {\tt PSI}

width, line style, visibility, etc. can be set by the \Rind{GSATT} 
routine for {\tt CHNAMS(N)} and or its descendants {\tt [GEOM 500]}.
This routine differs from \Rind{GDRAW} in the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item  The object to be drawn is identified by a full path. This gives 
the possibility of drawing a particular copy or division of a volume, or 
even a volume that has more than one mother in the geometry tree.
{\tt CHNAMS(1),...,CHNAMS(N)} contain the volume names and
{\tt LNUMBS(1),...,LNUMBS(N)}, the volume numbers defining the path 
to go from the top volume to the one to be drawn.
\item  The object can be drawn either with respect to the
{\tt MA}ster {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem ({\tt NRS=0}) or with respect 
to its {\tt D}augther {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem (i.e. the Local R.S.); 
in the first case it is drawn in its position in the real world, while 
in the second one it is drawn like \Rind{GDRAW} would do.
\item  In this latter case, track and hit points will be
drawn with respect to the {\tt DRS} of the volume last
drawn by this routine, and not with respect to the
{\tt MARS} as is done normally (to reset to the normal
case a call with {\tt NRS=0} or {\tt NNAMS=0} is required).
\end{itemize}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[NNAMS]     ({\tt INTEGER}) number of elements {\tt levels} in the 
arrays {\tt CHNAMS, LNUMBS}. The bottom volume of this path is also the 
one that is actually drawn;
\item[CHNAMS]   ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) array of volume name (dimensioned 
at least to {\tt NNAMS});
\item[LNUMBS]   array of volume numbers (dimensioned at least to {\tt NNAMS});
\item[NRS]    reference system used:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMM}
\item[NRS$=$0] to have the volume(s) drawn with respect to the {\tt MARS} 
\item[NRS$\neq$0] to have the volume(s) drawn with respect to the {\tt DRS}
\end{DLtt}
\item[THETA]   $\theta$ angle between the line of sight and the
                Z  axis of {\tt MARS};
\item[PHI]    $\phi$ angle between the projection of the line of sight
              on plane {\tt X Y} and the {\tt X} axis of {\tt MARS}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARECTER*4}) name of volume;
\item[CUTTHE] ({\tt REAL}) $\theta$ angle of the line normal to the cut plane;
\item[CUTPHI] ({\tt REAL}) $\phi$ angle of the line normal to the cut plane;

\item[SU]     ({\tt REAL}) scale factor for u  coordinates;
\item[SV]     ({\tt REAL}) scale factor for v   coordinates.
\end{DLtt}

Draws a {\it cut view} of the volume {\tt CHNAME}
with all its {\it visible} descendants, i.e. draws their intersection with
the cut plane normal to the axis
given by the angles {\tt CUTTHE, CUTPHI} at the distance {\tt CUTVAL}
from the origin.
The view point is defined by the angles {\tt THETA, PHI}.
{\tt U0, V0, SU, SV} have the same meaning as in \Rind{GDRAW}.
These {\it view parameters}, as well as zoom parameters set by \Rind{GDZOOM}
are copied in \FCind{/GCDRAW/}.

Attributes like colour, surface fill, line width, line style, visibility, etc.
can be set by the \Rind{GSATT} routine for {\tt CHNAME}
and its descendants {\tt [GEOM500]}.
 
\Shubr{GDRAWC}{(CHNAME,IAX,CUTVAL,U0,V0,SU,SV)}
 
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARECTER*4}) name of volume;
\item[IAX]  ({\tt INTEGER}) axis of the cut (1=X, 2=Y, 3=Z);
\item[U0]   ({\tt REAL}) u coordinate on the screen of the volume origin;
\item[V0]   ({\tt REAL}) v coordinate on the screen of the volume origin;
\item[SU]   ({\tt REAL}) scale factor for u coordinates;
\item[SV]   ({\tt REAL}) scale factor for v coordinates.
\end{DLtt}

This routine is a special case of the previous \Rind{GDRAWX}.
Here the cut plane is normal to one of the main axes ({\tt IAX})
and placed at a distance {\tt CUTVAL} from the origin.
The view-point is along the same axis.

\Makehead{Draw Particle Trajectories}
\section{Visualisation of particle trajectories}
The tracks generated by the tracking package, and optionally stored
in the data structure {\tt JXYZ}, can be displayed by the routine \Rind{GDXYZ}
(corresponding to the interactive command {\tt DXYZ}).
 
The names of the particles and or the track numbers can be added
by the routine \Rind{GDPART} (corresponding to the interactive command 
{\tt DPART}).
 
A special routine has been provided to visualise the tracks during the
transport process
(\Rind{GDCXYZ}), that could be called for instance by \Rind{GUSTEP}.
That routine shows the tracks while they are transported
by the tracking package of {\tt GEANT}, providing a useful interactive
debugging tool.

\Shubr{GDXYZ}{(ITRA)}
 
Draws track number {\tt ITRA} for which space points have been stored in bank
{\tt JXYZ} via calls to the routine \Rind{GSXYZ}. The view parameters are 
taken from \FCind{/GCDRAW/}.
\begin{DLtt}{MMM}
\item[ITRA] ({\tt INTEGER}) track number (if 0 all tracks are taken)
\end{DLtt}
The colour and line style corresponds to the track type :
\begin{center}
\newcommand{\Leaders}[2]{\leaders\hbox to #1{\hfil#2\hfil}\hfill}
\begin{tabular}{llp{3cm}}
(blue)  & dotted line for gammas
                                                    & \dotfill \\
(red)   & solid line for charged particles (except muons)
                                                    & \hrulefill \\
(black) & blank/dotted line for neutral hadrons or neutrinos
                                                    & \Leaders{3mm}{.} \\
(green) & dashed line for muons
                                                    & \Leaders{3mm}{-} \\
(yellow) & dotted line for \v{C}erenkov photons
                                                    & \dotfill
\end{tabular}\end{center}
\Shubr{GDPART}{(ITRA,ISEL,SIZE)}
Draws the particle names and/or the track numbers
of track {\tt ITRA}, supposing that its space points had been stored in 
the bank {\tt JXYZ} via the routine \Rind{GSXYZ}.
At present only primary tracks are displayed by \Rind{GDPART}
and their name or number is written at the end the track trajectory.
The view parameters are taken from \FCind{/GCDRAW/}.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[ITRA]  ({\tt INTEGER}) Track number (if 0 all tracks are taken)
\item[ISEL]  ({\tt INTEGER}) \\
             {\tt ISEL=x1} draws the track number, \\
             {\tt ISEL=1x} draws the particle name, \\
             {\tt ISEL=11} draws both.
\item[SIZE]  ({\tt REAL}) Character size in cm.
\end{DLtt}
\Shubr{GDCXYZ}{}
If \Rind{GDCXYZ} is called at tracking time (for instance by
\Rind{GUSTEP}), it draws the tracks while tracking is performed,
at the same time as
they are generated by the tracking package of {\tt GEANT}.
This is a very
useful interactive debugging tool. The line style is the same as for
\Rind {GDXYZ}.
The view parameters are taken from \FCind{/GCDRAW/}.

Here we give an example of the use of \Rind{GDPART}:
 
\begin{verbatim}
 CALL GSATT('HB','FILL',3)
 CALL GSATT('HE','FILL',1)
 - - - - -
 - - - - -
 
 CALL GDRAWC('OPAL',2,5.,10.,10.,0.013,0.013)
 CALL GDXYZ(0)
 CALL GDPART(0,11,0.25)
\end{verbatim}

\Makehead{Drawing Track Hits in Sensitive Detectors}
The hits generated by the tracking package and stored in the
data structure {\tt JHITS} can be displayed by the followingroutines:
\begin{enumerate}
\item draw one hit (\Rind{GDAHIT}); called by the user;
\item draw all the hits of trajectory type sets/ detectors (\Rind{GDHITS});
\item draw all the hits of calorimeter type sets/ detectors (\Rind{GDCHIT}).
\end{enumerate}

Different symbols for each subdetector can be used, chosen among
hardware characters (dots), software crosses, or from the {\tt HPLOT} table
of software characters.
The size of the software characters and crosses is given as an argument
to \Rind{GDAHIT} and \Rind{GDHITS}, while it is computed as a function of 
the hits value in \Rind{GDCHIT}.

The option {\tt H} of the interactive \Rind{MOVE} command gives the 
possibility
to rotate, zoom and translate in real time the hits stored for one event.
This allow a 3D display of the event where it is possible to pick one hit 
with the mouse and have the hit values printed.  The interactive 
command \Rind{LENS} allows a detailed visual scanning of the 
hits displayed (see the interactive section).   

\Shubr{GDHITS}{(CHUSET,CHUDET,ITRA,ISYMB,SSYMB)}
Draws the hit points as stored by \Rind{GSAHIT,} which were
generated by track {\tt ITRA} in detector {\tt CHUDET} of set {\tt CHUSET},
with the currently selected view parameters in \FCind{/GCDRAW/}.
The character plotted at each point may be chosen via {\tt ISYMB}:
 
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{2cm}}l@{\hspace{3cm}}r}
 -1     &  (small) hardware points            & (fast)      \\
  0     &  software crosses                   & (default)   \\
840/850 &  empty/full circles                 & (slow)      \\
841/851 &  empty/full squares                 & (slow)      \\
842/852 &  empty/full triangles (up)          & (slow)      \\
843/853 &  empty diamond/full triangle (down) & (slow)      \\
844/854 &  empty/full stars                   & (slow)      \\
\end{tabular}
 
More information on the meaning of the {\tt ISIMB} value can be found in the 
{\tt HPLOT} manual\cite{bib-HPLOT}. Any value for {\tt ISYMB} which is not
in the above table is equivalent to option 0. Except for {\tt ISYMB = -1},
the size of the character can be chosen by {\tt SSYMB}.
On the 2D projection on the screen one can distinguish which
set/detector a given track passes, by drawing different symbols for the
hits in different sets/detectors. The size of these symbols may then
be chosen to suit the scale of the total picture (detectors and tracks).

\end{DLtt}
\Shubr{GDCHIT}{(CHUSET,CHUDET,ITRA,ISYMB,SIZMAX,IHIT,HITMIN,HITMAX)}
Draws the hit points as stored by \Rind{GSCHIT}, which were
generated by track {\tt ITRA} in detector {\tt CHUDET} of set {\tt CHUSET},
with the currently selected view parameters in \FCind{/GCDRAW/}.
Except for {\tt  ISYMB = -1} the size of the character

\item [HITMIN]    ({\tt REAL}) minimum boundary of {\tt HITS(IHIT)}
\item[HITMAX]     ({\tt REAL}) maximum boundary of {\tt HITS(IHIT)}
\end{DLtt}
\Shubr{GDAHIT}{(X,Y,Z,ISYMB,SSYMB)}
Draws one hit point at coordinates {\tt X, Y, Z}. This routine is useful
when the user wants only to display but not to store the hits.
The first three arguments are the position of the hit in the {\tt MARS},
and the last two arguments have the same meaning as the similar 
arguments in GDHITS.
\begin{DLtt}{MM}
\item [X]  ({\tt REAL})       x coordinate in {\tt MARS} of the hit point
\item [Y]  ({\tt REAL})       y coordinate in {\tt MARS} of the hit point
\item [X]  ({\tt REAL})       z coordinate in {\tt MARS} of the hit point

\Makehead{Drawing the geometrical tree}
The geometrical tree is a hierarchical representation of the 
structure of the detector, based on the mother-daughter
relationship among the various volumes composing it. The \Rind{GDTREE} 
routine (corresponding to the {\tt DTREE} interactive command) allows 
the drawing of the logical tree, displaying name, multiplicity 
and other information about the volumes.

\Shubr{GDTREE}{(CHNAME,LEVMAX,ISEL)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME]  ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) volume name;
\item[LEVMAX]  ({\tt INTEGER}) depth levels (if 0 all levels are taken) 
default is 3;
\item[ISEL]    ({\tt INTEGER}) used to select options in the picture of the tree:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[~~~~0] only the node name is drawn;
\item[xxxx1] multiplicity is added: 
\begin{itemize}
\item each node that has been positioned several 
times (by \Rind{GSPOS} or \Rind{GSPOSP}) has a multiplicity number preceded by 
the symbol '*';
\item each node that has been obtained by division mechanism
(by \Rind{GSDVN}, \Rind{GSDVT}, etc.) has a multiplicity number preceded by the
symbol \#;
\end{itemize}
\item[xxx1x] {\tt ONLY} information is added.
volumes that are {\tt MANY} will be
drawn as three square nodes, one overlapping the others but slightly shifted;

{\bf Note:} if {\tt CHNAME} itself is {\tt MANY} it will not be recognised as 
such, because this information is stored in its mother which is unknown;

\item[xx1xx] {\tt DET} information is added; if a volumes is a detector it 
is drawn as a square node with another one slightly larger around it;
\item[x1xxx] {\tt SEEN} information is added;
if a volume is not seen (either because of its {\tt SEEN} attribute or
because of its ancestors {\tt SEEN} attributes affecting the whole tree path)
its square node is drawn by using dashed lines;
\item[1xxxx] a little picture of the volume is added above each node.
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}

\end{verbatim}
     \caption{Example of geometrical tree structure}
     \label{fg:draw210-1}
\end{figure}
\Rind{GDTREE} draws the tree of the volume data structure starting
from the volume {\tt CHNAME}, for {\tt LEVMAX} depth levels;
a continuation link line is drawn for those elements
at the last level on the picture but having descendants.
An example of use of \Rind{GDTREE} can be found in Fig.~\ref{fg:draw210-1}.
For every node, as many red arrows as the number of existing levels below it
are plotted on the link; vice versa, as many green arrows as the number of 
existing levels before it are also plotted.
When running {\tt GEANT} interactively, if the {\tt ISEL}
argument is not specified, control is given to the
mouse after issuing the {\tt DTREE} command. This allows the display of various
volume parameters and the navigation of the geometrical tree by
clicking the mouse buttons.
The size of the picture and the dimensions of each
element and arrows are computed automatically. 

\section*{Interactive use}
In an interactive session, control can be given to the mouse: 
\begin{itemize}
\item clicking on the left button when the cursor is inside a volume
{\it pave} will generate a \Rind{DSPEC} command for that volume; 
\item clicking the same button when the cursor is on a red arrow will 
perform a \Rind{DTREE} for the volume preceding the arrow, displaying a
number of levels which depends on the which arrow has been selected;
\item selecting in the same way the i$^{th}$ green arrow preceding 
a given volume will perform a \Rind{DTREE}
for its mother-volume staying {\it i} levels before;

When running with the X-windows software, the drawing of the 
specification (\Rind{DSPEC}) appears in a different window to 
speed up the scanning of the tree. Iterating this procedure it is 
possible to analyse very easily and quickly any kind of geometry. 
This drawing tree capability can be very
useful when tuning the detector geometry.
See the interactive section {\tt [XINT]} for examples.

\Makehead{Drawing volume specifications}
The geometrical parameters of the volumes can be displayed via the 
\Rind{GDSPEC} routine (corresponding to the {\tt DSPEC} interactive 
command). This facility provides a detailed picture of a particular 
piece of the detector. 
The set of geometrical specifications 
of all the descendants of a given node on the tree, can be obtained
each on a separate picture with the routine \Rind{GDFSPC} ({\tt DFSPC} 
interactive command).

\Shubr{GDSPEC}{(CHNAME)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) volume name;
\end{DLtt}
Draws a picture showing all specifications for a given volume.
An example of use of \Rind{GDSPEC} can be found in Fig.~\ref{fg:draw220-1}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]

     \epsfig{file=eps/draw220-1.eps,width=14cm}
     \caption{Example of use of {\tt GDSPEC}}
     \label{fg:draw220-1}
\end{figure}

The following information on the volume are
presented in a single frame:
\begin{itemize}
\item the volume daughters (one level down in the geometrical tree);
\item a space view of the volume (with $\theta$=45 and $\phi$=135);
\item a front view cut; 
\item a side view cut; 
\item the axes of the local coordinate system;
\item a human figure;
\item the scale;
\item the shape type;
\item all the numerical parameters that define the volume.
\end{itemize}
In drawing the volumes \Rind{GDSPEC} turns on the sets visibility 
({\tt 'SEEN'}) attribute for the volume {\tt CHNAME}
itself and its direct descendents. The setting of drawing options
({\tt HIDE}, {\tt CVOL}, {\tt FILL} $\ldots$) will be respected, allowing to 
customise the drawing. An example is shown in Fig.~\ref{fg:draw220-2}.

     \caption{Example of use of {\tt GDSPEC}}
     \label{fg:draw220-2}
\end{figure}

\Shubr{GDFSPC}{(CHNAME,ISORT,INTER)}
Draws on separate pictures the full set of \Rind{GDSPEC} for the geometrical
tree starting from {\tt CHNAME}, i.e. calls \Rind{GDSPEC} for
the volume {\tt CHNAME} and for all its descendants.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) volume name;
\item[ISORT] ({\tt INTEGER}) alphabetic sorting flag;
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[$= 1$] all the volumes will be drawn in ascending alphabetic order
according to their name;
\item[$\neq 1$] the volumes will be drawn in the order in which they
have been created;
\end{DLtt}
\item[INTER] ({\tt INTEGER}) interactive/batch version flag;
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[$= 1$] the routine will prompt the user at each plot
before doing a clear screen;
\item[$\neq 0$] the routine will clear automatically the screen 
before starting a new frame.
\end{DLtt}

{\bf Note:} {\tt INTER} should be set to 1 when using the interactive version 
of {\tt GEANT} and to any other value when using a batch version.

\Makehead{Handling View banks}
\section{The view banks}
The basic detector drawing routines (\Rind{GDRAW}, \Rind{GDRAWC}, 
\Rind{GDRAWX}) scan the data structure {\tt JVOLUM} repeatedly to
extract position and dimension information on the volumes. This can
be a rather lengthy process even on fast computer. 
Hidden line removal drawing requires
an auxiliary data structure and the 
relative visibility of all the volumes has to be analysed. With complicated 
detectors the time spent in this process can be substantial, depending 
on the drawing options chosen and on the speed of the machine on which 
the program is run. In order to alleviate this problem the graphic
{\it banks} and the associated routines have been developed.

The interpretation
of the structure (for instance scanning of the volumes' data structure 
to convert the 3D geometry structure into a set 
of 2D lines, visibility analysis, surface creation or
light processing) is thus separate
from the drawing itself. In this way, the interpretation is performed 
only once and all the 2D information is stored in view banks (data 
structure {\tt JDRAW} {\tt [DRAW399]}). These views can then be displayed
quickly, having only to draw the 2D vectors or the fill
areas previously stored. 

For a detector with more than 100 different volumes, for example, 
this costs only a few thousand words of memory for 
each drawing stored.

If the drawing routines are called while a view bank, identified by
a positive integer, is open (\Rind{GDOPEN})
only interpretation will be made,
no output will be generated until the bank is closed (\Rind{GDCLOS}).
When a view bank has been closed it cannot be modified, but
it can be displayed as many times as wanted (\Rind{GDSHOW}) or deleted
(\Rind{GDELET}).

Once a drawing (detectors, tracks or hits) is in a view bank, it is 
possible to scan it in detail via the {\tt LENS} or {\tt ZOOM} interactive
commands (only available with {\tt X11}). For more information see
the {\tt [XINT]} section.

\Shubr{GDOPEN}{(IVIEW)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[IVIEW] ({\tt INTEGER}) view bank number ({\tt IVIEW>0}).
\end{DLtt}

Opens a {\it view bank}, used to store 2D graphics information
coming from the interpretation of 3D structures (but also 2D annotation).
All subsequent calls to the drawing routines will fill the
view bank {\tt IVIEW}, without generating any output.
\Shubr{GDCLOS}{}
Closes the current opened view bank. Once a view bank has been closed
no more drawing can be added to it. A call to \Rind{GDCLOS} also restores the
screen.

\Shubr{GDSHOW}{(IVIEW)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[IVIEW] ({\tt INTEGER}) view bank number ({\tt IVIEW>0}).
\end{DLtt}

Displays view bank {\tt IVIEW}. \Rind{GDSHOW} can be called either
before or after a view bank has been closed. If a view bank is currently
open, the content of bank {\tt IVIEW} will be added to it.

\begin{figure}[hbt]

     \epsfig{file=eps/draw300-1.eps,width=12.cm}
\begin{verbatim}
      CALL GDOPEN(3)

      CALL GDCLOS
      CALL GDSHOW(3)
      .
      .
      CALL GDXYZ(0)
\end{verbatim}
     \caption{Example of use of view banks}
     \label{fg:draw300-1}
\end{figure}
 
\Shubr{GDELET}{(IVIEW)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[IVIEW] ({\tt INTEGER}) view bank number ({\tt IVIEW>0}).
\end{DLtt}

Deletes a view bank from memory. If called before a bank has been closed,
\Rind{GDELET} will also restore the screen mode. 

{\bf Note:} the {\tt JDRAW} data structure has a top level bank which 
contains one word for each view bank in {\tt Q(JDRAW+IVIEW)}. This
word is a key which determines the status of the bank. If this key 
is 3, the bank itself is protected against deletion, and it cannot be 
deleted by \Rind{GDELET}. An example of use of view banks is shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fg:draw300-1}.

\Shubr{GDOPT}{(CHOPT,CHVAL)}
 
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHOPT] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) option to be set;
\item[CHVAL] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) value to be assigned to the option.
\end{DLtt}

Drawing options can be set via the routine \Rind{GDOPT} 
(corresponding to the {\tt DOPT} interactive command).
The possible value of {\tt CHOPT} and of {\tt CHVAL} are the following:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[PROJ] selects the type of projection, it can have the following
values:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[PARA] orthographic parallel projection (the default);
\item[PERS] perspective projection.
\end{DLtt}
\item[THRZ] acronym for {\tt T}racks and {\tt H}its in a {\tt R}adius 
versus {\tt Z} projection, where {\tt R} is the {\it vertical} axis
of the drawing and
{\tt Z} the horizontal one. If a {\it cut view} has been drawn with the
following parameters:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMM}
\item[X-Z cut] {\tt CUTTHE=90} and {\tt CUTPHI=90} in \Rind{GDRAWX} or
{\tt icut=2} in \Rind{GDRAWC};
\item[Y-Z cut] {\tt CUTTHE=90} and {\tt CUTPHI=180} in \Rind{GDRAWX} or
{\tt icut=1} in \Rind{GDRAWC}.
\end{DLtt}
the different values of the option {\tt THRZ} have the following effect
on the drawing of hits and tracks:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[360] hits and tracks will be rotated around {\tt Z} onto the
{\tt Z-R, R$>$0} half plane;
\item[180] (equivalent to {\tt ON}) hits and tracks will be rotated
around {\tt Z} onto the {\tt Z-R} plane by the smaller $\phi$ angle,
so to conserve the sign of their {\tt R}-ordinate (where {\tt R} is
either {\tt X} or {\tt Y};
\item[OFF] (the default) tracks and hits will be projected from their
position in space onto the plane {\tt R-Z}.
\end{DLtt}
 
{\bf Note:} when the {\tt THRZ} option is set to {\tt ON} or {\tt 180},
particles originating in one half space and crossing the horizontal axis
will be reflected back into the original half space. If the option 
{\tt 360} can be 
chosen, all tracks and hits are on the top (positive) half space.
\item[TRAK] selects the way tracks are drawn. Possible values:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[LINE] (the default) the lines joining track points are drawn by 
{\tt GDXYZ};
\item[POIN] only the track points are drawn.
\end{DLtt}
\item[HIDE] selects the hidden line removal technique for the
drawings. Possible values are:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[OFF] (the default) hidden lines are not removed from the drawing:
the drawing is usually rather fast, but the result can be
quite messy if a large number of volumes is visible;
\item[ON] hidden lines are not drawn: if this value is selected, the 
detector can be exploded (interactive command {\tt BOMB}), cut with 
different shapes (interactive command menu {\tt CVOL}), and some parts 
can be shifted from their original position (interactive command 
{\tt SHIFT}). Drawing with hidden line removal can be demanding in
terms of CPU time and memory. At the end of each drawing
the program displays the memory used and the statistics on the 
volume visibility. When the drawing requires more memory 
than available, the program will evaluate and display the number of 
missing words, so that the user can increase accordingly the
size of the \Rind{ZEBRA} store in the common \FCind{/GCBANK/}.
\end{DLtt}
\item[SHAD] when {\tt HIDE} is {\tt ON}, selects the 
shading and filling option for the detector's surfaces that are drawn:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[OFF] (the default) no shading of the surfaces will be performed;
\item[ON]  the volume surfaces will be filled according to the value of 
their {\tt FILL} and {\tt LWID} attribute, set via {\tt GSATT}:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[FILL$=$1] the surfaces are filled with the current colour assigned
to the volume via \Rind{GSATT}, 166 different colours are available;
\item[FILL$>$1] the surfaces are filled with a shade of the basic colour
assigned to the volume according to their angle with respect to the line
of illumination, the resolution
increases with the value of {\tt FILL} (1$<$ {\tt FILL} $\leq$ 7);
\item[LWID$>$0] just as the number of scan-lines used to fill a surface
depends on the value of {\tt FILL}, their width depends on the value of 
{\tt LWID}: increasing the value of {\tt LWID} will result in thicker lines.
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}
\item[EDGE] control drawing of the volume edges in {\tt HIDE=ON, FILL=ON}
mode:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[ON] the edges of the faces are not drawn,
so that they will be visible only as intersections of filled faces
with different luminosity; 
\item[OFF] the edges of the faces are drawn.
For the volumes which are not filled, the normal
edges will be drawn irrespective of the value of this option.
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}

\Shubr{GDZOOM}{(ZFU,ZFV,UZ0,VZ0,U0,V0)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[ZFU]    ({\tt REAL}) zoom factor for {\tt U} coordinate;
\item[ZFV]    ({\tt REAL}) zoom factor for {\tt V} coordinate;
\item[UZ0]    ({\tt REAL}) {\tt U} coordinate of centre of zoom;
\item[VZ0]    ({\tt REAL}) {\tt V} coordinate of centre of zoom;
\item[U0]     ({\tt REAL}) {\tt U} coordinate of centre of zoom 
in the resulting picture;
\item[V0]     ({\tt REAL}) {\tt V} coordinate of centre of zoom 
in the resulting picture.
\end{DLtt}
This routine sets the zoom parameters (part of the viewing parameters 
in common \FCind{/GCDRAW/}) that define how objects 
will be displayed by the subsequent drawing operations.
The zoom is computed around {\tt UZ0}, {\tt VZ0} (user coordinates).
This point will be moved to {\tt U0}, {\tt V0} in the resulting picture.
{\tt ZFU}, {\tt ZFV} are the zoom factors (positive). If {\tt ZFU} 
or {\tt ZFV} are zero, the zoom parameters are reset, and the 
original viewing is restored.

\Shubr{GDAXIS}{(X0,Y0,Z0,AXSIZ)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[X0]    ({\tt REAL}) {\tt X} coordinate of origin;
\item[Y0]    ({\tt REAL}) {\tt Y} coordinate of origin;
\item[Z0]    ({\tt REAL}) {\tt Z} coordinate of origin;
\item[AXSIZ] ({\tt REAL}) axis size in centimeters.
\end{DLtt}
Draws the axes of the {\tt MA}ster {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem,
corresponding to the current viewing parameters.
All the arguments refer to the {\tt MARS}.

\Shubr{GDWMN3}{(U0,V0)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[U0]     ({\tt REAL}) {\tt U} coordinate of the centre of the figure;
\item[V0]     ({\tt REAL}) {\tt V} coordinate of the centre of the figure.
\end{DLtt}
Draws the profile of a man, or three different female figures
in 2D user coordinates, with the current scale factors.
The figure is approximately 160 cm high.

\Shubr{GDRAWT}{(U,V,CHTEXT,SIZE,ANGLE,LWIDTH,IOPT)}
\begin{DLtt} {MMMMMMMM}

\end{DLtt}
Draws text with software characters. It has the same
arguments of the {\tt HPLOT}\cite{bib-HPLOT} routine \Rind{HPLSOF} 
(a call to \Rind{HPLSOF} is actually performed).

\item[xx1xxx] select thick characters for text in top of head (i.e. 
with larger line width);
\item[x1xxxx] add the text {\tt EVENT NR x} on top of header;
\item[1xxxxx] add the text {\tt RUN NR x} on top of header.
\end{DLtt}

{\bf Note:} {\tt ISEL=x1xxx1} or {\tt ISEL=1xxxx1} are illegal choices,
i.e. they generate overwritten text.
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) title string;
\item[CHRSIZ] ({\tt REAL}) character size (cm) of text {\tt CHNAME}.
\end{DLtt}
This routine draws a frame header.

\Shubr{GDCOL}{(ICOL)}

{\bf This routine has been kept for backward compatibility. The appropriate
{\tt HIGZ} routines should be called instead.}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[ICOL] ({\tt INTEGER}) colour code (1,2,\ldots,8), 
it can be positive, negative, 
or zero:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[$>$0] to set the colour permanently;
\item[$<$0] to set the colour temporarily;
\item[$=$0] to restore the permanent colour value.
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}
This routine sets the colour code.
For example we can set {\tt ICOL=-1} to start with colour  1,
then change to {\tt ICOL=3} to set colour  3, and at the end
restore the original colour by setting {\tt ICOL=0} that
takes colour  1 again.

\Shubr{GDLW}{(LW)}

{\bf This routine has been kept for backward compatibility. The appropriate
{\tt HIGZ} routines should be called instead.}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[ LW] ({\tt INTEGER}) line width code (1,2,\ldots,5), it can be positive, 
negative, or zero:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[$>$0] to set the line width permanently;
\item[$<$0] to set the line width temporarily;
\item[$=$0] to restore the permanent line width value.
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}
This routine sets the line width.
For example we can set {\tt LW=-1} to start with line width  1,
then change to {\tt LW=3} to set line width 3, and at the end
restore the original line width by setting {\tt LW=0} that
takes line width  1 again.

\Shubr{GDCURS}{(U0*,V0*,ICHAR*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[U0]   ({\tt REAL}) {\tt U} coordinate of the graphics cursor;
\item[V0]   ({\tt REAL}) {\tt V} coordinate of the graphics cursor;
\item[ICHAR] ({\tt INTEGER}) {\tt ASCII} value of the key pressed.
\end{DLtt}
A graphics input is provided by this routine to fetch the 2D user coordinates
of the graphics cursor on the screen.
Interactive commands to zoom, 
measure, or pick tracks or hits make use of this routine.
When the routine is called in the interactive
version of {\tt GEANT},
the present position of the graphics cursor on the screen becomes visible and
it can be moved with the mouse. The user then positions the 
cursor and presses the left button. 
The routine returns then in {\tt U0}, {\tt V0} the user coordinates
of the graphics cursor.
On terminals which do not have the mouse, the graphic cursor is moved
with the arrows, and the point is acquired when any key, except {\it carriage
return}, is pressed. In this case the routine returns in {\tt ICHAR} the 
{\tt ASCII} value of the key pressed. If the user types the carriage return, 
the previous value is retained.

\Shubr{GDFR3D}{(X,NPOINT,U*,V*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[X]      ({\tt REAL}) array {\tt X(3,NPOINT)} of space points;
\item[NPOINT] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of points:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[$>$0] {\tt X} is in the current {\tt DRS};
\item[$<$0] {\tt X} is in {\tt MARS};
\end{DLtt}
\item[U]  ({\tt REAL}) array of {\tt NPOINT U} coordinates;
\item[V]  {(\tt REAL}) array of {\tt NPOINT V} coordinates.
\end{DLtt}
Converts from 3D space coordinates (either in {\tt MA}ster or 
{\tt D}aughter {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem) to the corresponding 2D 
user coordinates.
 
This routine maps a space point ({\tt X, Y, Z} in a right-handed reference 
system) onto a plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight,
defined by the spherical angles $\theta$, $\phi$:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[${\tt \theta}$] the angle between the line of sight and the {\tt Z} 
axis ($0 \leq \theta \leq 180$);
\item[${\tt \phi}$] the angle between the {\tt X} axis and the projection 
onto the {\tt X-Y} plane of the line of sight ($0 \leq \phi \leq 360$).
\end{DLtt}
The plane onto which the point is mapped is actually the {\tt X-Y} plane 
of the {\tt P}rojection {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem, and
the observer's line of sight is the {\tt Z} axis of {\tt PRS}. The vertical 
axis on
this plane ({\tt Y} axis on {\tt PRS}) is obtained by intersecting this plane
with the one of {\tt MARS} or {\tt DRS} containing the line of sight and 
the {\tt Y} axis.

\Shubr{GD3D3D}{(XIN,NPOINT,XOUT*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[XIN]   ({\tt REAL}) array {\tt XIN(3,NPOINT)} of input points in 
{\tt MARS};
\item[NPOINT] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of points;
\item[XOUT]   ({\tt REAL}) array {\tt XOUT(3,NPOINT)} of output points 
in {\tt PRS}.
\end{DLtt}
Converts from 3D space coordinates in {\tt MARS}
to 3D coordinates in {\tt P}rojection {\tt R}eference 
{\tt S}ystem (whose {\tt Z} axis is along
the line of sight given by $\theta$ and $\phi$ angles).

\Makehead{The geometry package}

The geometry package has two main functions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item define, during the initialisation of the program,
the geometry in which the particles will be tracked;
\item communicate, during the event processing phase, to the tracking 
routines the information for 
the transport of the particles in the geometry which has been defined.
\end{enumerate}

The present section reviews the concepts of the geometry package and explains
how the geometrical information should be provided by the user.
It is important to point out that, once the geometry has been defined,
the tracking of particles through the different volumes proceeds without any
intervention from the user {\tt [TRAK]}. 

The connection between the
geometry and tracking packages is established by the subroutines
\Rind{GMEDIA}/\Rind{GTMEDI}, \Rind{GTNEXT}/\Rind{GNEXT} and
\Rind{GINVOL} which answer respectively the questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item    In which volume is a given point ?
\item    What is the distance to the nearest volume along the trajectory
of the particle ?
\item    What is the distance to the nearest volume ?
\item    Is a given point still in the current volume ?
\end{itemize}
The routines \Rind{GTMEDI}, \Rind{GTNEXT} are used in a dynamic context,
at tracking time, when the
knowledge of the track direction can be used to save time.
\section{ The volume definition }

Experimental setups, as complex as the LEP\footnote{The Large Electron Positron
collider in operation at CERN.} detectors, can be described 
rather accurately through the definition of a set of {\it volumes}.
Each {\it volume} is given a {\it name} and is characterised by:
\begin{itemize}
\item a {\it shape} identifier, specifying one of the basic
          geometrical shapes available {\tt [GEOM050]};
\item   the {\it shape} parameters, giving the dimensions of the volume;
\item   a local reference system, with origin and axes defined
for the each shape;
\item    the physical properties, given by a set of constants describing the
homogeneous {\it material} which fills the volume ({\tt [CONS]});
\item  additional properties, known as {\it tracking medium} parameters,
which depend on the characteristics of the volume itself (the
material identifier is one of the constants) and on its geometrical and
physical environment (properties of the neighbouring volumes, magnetic field, 
etc.) {\tt [CONS, TRAK]};
\item  a set of attributes, in connection with the drawing package
and the detector response package {\tt [DRAW, HITS]}.
\end{itemize}
Until it is {\it positioned} in a given reference frame,
a volume is an entity which has no spatial relation with the other volumes.
By convention, a unique initial volume has to be defined first
which will contain
all the other volumes. The reference frame intrinsic
to this volume is considered to be the master reference frame.

There are sixteen basic shapes in {\tt GEANT}, which are described in
{\tt [GEOM050]}.

\section{Volumes with contents}
A {\it volume} can be declared to have contents and as such it becomes a 
{\it mother}
volume. The contents are {\it either} predefined volumes which are explicitly 
positioned inside the mother, {\it or} new volumes which are implicitly defined
by a division mechanism applied to the mother. Positioning a volume with given 
shape and dimensions inside a mother volume is obtained by specifying its 
translation and rotation with respect to the mother reference frame. The user 
should make sure that no volume extends beyond the boundaries of its mother.

When a volume is positioned, the user gives it a {\it number}. Multiple copies 
of the same volume can be positioned inside the same or different mothers
as long as their copy numbers differ.
The contents of the positioned volume are reproduced 
in all copies. 

Mother volumes can be divided by planes along the three axes ($ x, y, z$),
radially along $R_{xy}$, or along the spherical coordinates of a 
polar system: $R$, $\theta$ and $\phi$. The axis along which it is
possible to perform a division depend on the shape to be divided. The
general rule is that the result of the division be still a {\tt GEANT} shape.

A volume can be partially or totally divided.
The division process
generates a number of {\it cells}, which are considered as new volumes.
The cell dimensions are computed
according to the number of divisions or the step size. A cell, as any
other volume, can again be divided, or have other
volumes positioned into it. Any operation of positioning or division
performed on one cell is repeated to all the cells resulting
from the division. A volume can be {\it either} divided {\it or} have
contents, but not the two things together.

These operations define a physical tree with several
levels. The material and properties of the contents replace the
ones of the mother within the space region they occupy.
A {\tt volume} is therefore defined not only by its intrinsic characteristics
but also by those of its {\it descendants}, namely its contents (by
division or positioning), the contents of its contents, etc.

\section{ Overlapping volumes, see also {\tt [GEOM020]} }
The user may define volumes which have no relation with the real
objects. It is sometimes convenient to make use of such volumes,
to artificially delimit regions with simple shapes.
Doing this, it may happen that
volumes partially overlap each other. (A volume positioned inside a mother is
obviously not regarded as overlapping the mother).

It is possible in {\tt GEANT} to handle partially overlapping volumes, but
there are some implications that the user should be aware of.
A flag {\tt 'ONLY'/'MANY'} is assigned to each copy of a given volume at the 
moment this is positioned. The {\tt 'MANY'} option indicates that
a point found in this volume could also be in other volumes which are
not its direct descendants. If one of the
overlapping volumes where the point is found is declared as {\tt 'ONLY'}, the
geometry subroutines will give priority to this volume, 
and the search stops.
If a point is inside several {\tt 'MANY'} volumes and outside all {\tt 'ONLY'}
ones, priority will be given to the volume
found at the deepest level, or to the first found, if there are many
valid {\tt 'MANY'} candidates at the same level. In order to avoid ambiguities,
two overlapping {\tt 'MANY'} volumes should in general
have the same tracking medium.

\section{The physical tree}
An example of a 4 level physical tree with embedded volumes and
the corresponding geometrical configuration are shown in fig~\ref{fg:geom001-1}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
      \centering
      \epsfig{file=eps/geom001-1.eps,width=16cm}
      \caption{Example of geometrical tree structure}
      \label{fg:geom001-1}
\end{figure}

where A and B are {\tt BOX}es, C a {\tt TRAP}ezoid, and D and E {\tt TUBE}s
(see {\tt [GEOM050]} for more detail).
Notice that the same physical configuration could be described as well though
a 3 level tree if D were defined as a {\it hollow}
{\tt TUBE}, with inner radius non-zero and E
directly positioned into B.
The package accepts a maximum of 15 levels, which should be
enough to represent the fine details of a complex structure.
\section{The data structures {\tt JVOLUM} and {\tt JGPAR}
and the common {\tt /GCVOLU/}}

In practice, the physical tree is not represented as such in the
data part of the program. Instead, a logical tree structure is defined,
the {\tt JVOLUM} data structure, which describes the arrangement of
volumes in a compact and recurrent way. Each generic volume appears once,
and once only, and carries the information relevant to the volume itself
and to its contents, if any, by reference to the
generic volumes corresponding to those contents.
In the situation where division or multiple copies occur, there
is no longer a one-to-one correspondence between a volume in the
logical tree and a region in space. Information has to be added at
tracking time to identify which division cell or which copy was considered
at each depth level along the path through the physical tree. This
information is stored by the subroutine \Rind{GMEDIA}/\Rind{GTMEDI}, for the
current point of the current track, in the common \FCind{/GCVOLU/}. It includes
the current level number {\tt NLEVEL} and, for each level, starting from the
first mother volume, the identification of the corresponding volume, e.g.:
{\tt NAME}, {\tt  NUMBER}, {\tt 'ONLY'/'MANY'} flag, translation and rotation
with respect to the master reference frame and so on. 
The number of shape parameters
and pointers to the vector describing the actual values of those
parameters, for each level, are stored in the data part and in the link
part, of the data structure {\tt JGPAR}, respectively.

\section{The user tools }

The geometry through which the particles are transported is defined by the
user via a set of calls to subroutines of the {\tt GEANT} package.

The user can define a volume through a call to the subroutine:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[\Rind{GSVOLU}] define ({\it instantiate}) a volume by giving a 
{\tt NAME} and the actual parameters to a shape; the position of the volume 
inside the bank {\tt JVOLUM} is returned. If any of the parameters which
express a length is negative, {\tt GEANT} will assign to this parameter
at tracking time
the maximum value allowed, without protruding out of the mother 
which contains the particle transported.

A shape can be instantiated
into a volume also without actual parameters. These will then be supplied
when positioning each copy of the volume via the \Rind{GSPOSP} routine (see
below). This allows to have many {\it similar} volumes with the same name
and shape, but different actual parameters in each copy.
\end{DLtt}

The user can position a volume through a call to either one of the following 
subroutines:

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[\Rind{GSPOS}] position a copy of a volume inside its mother with respect 
to the mother's reference system. A a point in space, a rotation matrix
index, a copy number and the {\tt 'ONLY'/'MANY'} flag are supplied;
\item[\Rind{GSPOSP}] position a copy of a volume which has been instantiated
without actual parameters inside its mother with respect to the mother reference
system. The parameters of the copy being positioned are supplied as well.
The volumes will be identified by name and copy number as for multiple copies
of the same volume.
\end{DLtt}
The user can divide a volume through a call to either one of the following
subroutines:

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMM}
\item[\Rind{GSDVN}] divide a volume in a given {\it number} of cells completely
filling the mother. In this case the cell tracking medium
is assumed to be the same as for the mother. See also \Rind{GSDVN2}.
\item[\Rind{GSDVT}] divide a volume with slices of a given {\it step}.
The cell tracking medium can be different from the one of the mother.
See also \Rind{GSDVT2}.
\item[\Rind{GSDVX}] divide a volume starting from a given offset. In addition 
to {\tt STEP} and {\tt NDIV} (with at least one of them positive to be 
effectively useful), the origin of the first cell, the cell tracking medium 
and eventually the computed (maximum) number of divisions must be specified.
\end{DLtt}


\section{Geometrical information retrieval}

The parameters of a volume may depend on the physical tree which leads to
this volume. The dimensions of one of the slices of a cone divided along
{\tt Z} depends on which slice we consider. So a volume is completely
defined only if we specify the path in the tree. This is composed by the
name and copy number of the volumes containing the one we are interested
in, from the first mother.

Given this information, the routine \Rind{GLVOLU} is capable to fill the
common \FCind{/GCVOLU/}, and the structure {\tt JGPAR} with the actual
parameters of the instance chosen.

\Makehead{Tracking inside volumes and optimisation}



The tracking of particles through the geometrical data structure is the key
functionality of {\tt GEANT}. 
At every particle's step, the program must find the
volume where the particle is ({\tt GTMEDI}) and the next boundary it will cross
({\tt GTNEXT}). This can take
about $60\%$ of the total simulation time (even for detectors described
in an optimized way); therefore, a new logic has been introduced to minimize
the time spent for the search in the geometrical tree. 

\section{ Virtual divisions}

Instead of a linear or
binary search (time spent proportional or logarithmic with the number of
volumes, respectively), a `direct access' technique has been developed to
make the time basically independent from the number of volumes. Every volume
containing other volumes is `virtually' divided in equal slices at 
initialization time via the call to {\tt GGCLOS}
(the best axis is computed automatically). 
For each slice,
a data structure is filled with a list of the volumes 
identifiers intersecting such
slice. 
Slices with identical lists are pointing to the same contents
and are collected. At 
tracking time it is immediate to find in which slice the particle is and only
its contents have to be checked. The same is true to find the next boundary to
be crossed: only if the intersection point with a content lies outside the 
current collection of slices, the next one will be checked. The algorithm
gives in average about a factor 2 in speed for the overall simulation in the
large detectors. It also minimizes the dependency of the performance
on the skill and experience of the programmer and allows a fast tracking even
in geometrical structures received from CAD systems.

\section{ Other optimisation tools}

The following facilities are kept for backward compatibility reasons.
If called by the user, these optimisation tools are called at 
initialisation time, but not used at tracking time. Instead, the
new optimisation using 'virtual divisions' is performed.
If the user wants to use the older optimisation tools, he can 
recompile {\tt GEANT} 3.21 using the {\tt PATCHY} flag {\tt +OLD}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \Rind{GSORD}/\Rind{GGORD}

From the position of the contents inside a given volume, the
subroutine \Rind{GSORD} computes fictitious
boundaries along the specified coordinate, simulating
a division with irregular step size. A binary search technique is used
to identify within which pseudo-cell the current point is. The slow process
of computing whether the point is inside or outside the contents is therefore
limited to the few (if any) volumes overlapping with that
pseudo-cell, as sketched in fig~\ref{fg:geom001-2}.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
      \centering
      \epsfig{file=eps/geom001-2.eps,width=16cm}
      \caption{Example of pseudo-cells created by {\tt GSORD}}
      \label{fg:geom001-2}
\end{figure}

The coordinate selected for the pseudo division can be any of
{\tt X, Y, Z, $R_{xy}$, $R$, $\phi$ or $\theta$;}.
For a given volume, the call to \Rind{GSORD} has to come after all its first
level contents have been positioned.

\item
\Rind{GSNEXT}/\Rind{GSNEAR}

when a particle exits from a daugther of a 
mother volume, the contents are scanned initially
in the order in which 
they have been positioned, and the user should take care over
the best sequence of \Rind{GSPOS} calls. However, when the particle
{\it  comes back}
inside the mother from any one of the contents, it is
usually possible to limit the search to the neighbour contents.
The subroutines \Rind{GSNEXT}/\Rind{GSNEAR} permit the user to inject, at
initialisation time, for each content
in turn, the list of neighbours to search for.
\Rind{GSNEAR} is recommended, \Rind{GSNEXT} is kept for backward,
compatibility and has a different default option. A proper use of this
facility can reduce the search time significantly.

\item \Rind{GSUNEA}/\Rind{GUNEAR}

The volumes to be checked when exiting from one daughter can depend on 
the direction and position of the exiting particles. To optimise tracking
taking into account these dynamic features, the user can code the
\Rind{GUNEAR} routine, and inform {\tt GEANT} that it has to use it
at tracking time by calling the \Rind{GSUNEA} routine.
\end{enumerate}

\Makehead{`{\tt MANY}' Volumes and boolean operations on volumes}

The topology of 
{\tt GEANT} is given by 16 general shapes which are used to represent
solids in the design of detectors. These shapes are bounded by 2-nd order
surfaces for reasons of speed at tracking time. New tools have been 
introduced to extend the power of the {\tt GEANT} geometry: boolean operations 
(union, intersection and subtraction) between such shapes are now allowed, so
that an infinity of new shapes can be built; divisions along arbitrary axis
are now possible, allowing to exploit any simmetry in the design.
The tracking is now able to handle overlapping volumes in the most general
sense: the concept of {\tt MANY} volumes has been extended to automatic 
clipping 
for protuding objects. Thanks to this {\tt MANY} technique, 
any 3D or 2D geometrical
pattern can be reduced to a single dimensional structure, basically cancelling
the need for {\tt GUNEAR} at tracking time. 
Finally, more than one order of magnitude in speed has been gained compared
to the old step search algorithm used to track in {\tt MANY} volumes. \\[.5cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item Topological extensions via boolean operations.
\item Divisions along arbitrary axis.
\item Reduction of 2D structure to 1D structure.
\item Logic and algorithm.
\end{itemize} 
 
\section{Topological extensions via boolean operations}

Boolean operations between a given set of shapes allow the creation of an
infinite number of shapes. Adding a single new primitive (for ex. a toroid) to 
the basic set of shapes, all the possible combinations with all the old shapes
become moreover possible.\\[.5cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item UNION: the union of two volumes B and C is obtained positioning two
             overlapping `{\tt MANY}' daughters B and C inside the same mother
             A.
             To identify the result of the union as a single volume is enough
             to create a SET associated to the volumes B and C. 
\item SUBTRACTION: the subtraction of a volume B from a volume C is obtained
                   positioning B as `{\tt ONLY}' and C as a `{\tt MANY}' 
                   overlapping B.
                   The result of the subtraction is automatically what the
                   tracking sees as the C volume, so {\tt GSPOS} is the only 
                   user
                   interface needed. The volume B can have the same material as
                   the mother A or not. The normal positioning technique used
                   for `{\tt ONLY}s' is a particular case of boolean subtraction (a
                   volume is contained inside the other).
\item INTERSECTION: the intersection of two volumes B and C is obtained 
                    positioning a protuding `{\tt MANY}' object C in 
                    a `{\tt MANY}' object
                    B which is normally placed in a `{\tt ONLY}' mother A. A and B
                    must have the same material, while C has the material asked
                    for the intersection. The intersection is given by the part
                    of C which is not protuding from B, therefore by what the
                    new tracking sees as the volume C: again the only needed
                    user interface is {\tt GSPOS}. If not interacting with other
                    daughters of A, B could also be `{\tt ONLY}'. Without any
                    ambiguity, even further `{\tt MANY}' daughters of A can overlap
                    the protuding part of C outside B, because it is really
                    invisible to the new tracking. 
\end{itemize}
 
\section{Divisions along arbitrary axis}

As protuding {\tt MANY} daughters are automatically clipped by their mother, 
it is
possible to divide objects along arbitrary directions. Suppose for example
that we want to divide a PCON into planar slices parallel to the plane
X + Y = 0; it is enough to position a {\tt MANY} BOX embedding completely the
PCON `inside' the PCON itself; the BOX must be rotated of 45 degrees in X and
Y and then divided along one of its natural axis. Another example can be the
following: suppose we want to divide 24 times in PHI a PGON with only 6 natural
segmentations in PHI; 
then we have to position a {\tt MANY} TUBE, completely embedding
the PGON, `inside' the PGON itself; again, we can now divide the tube in 24
slices in PHI and the tracking will see only the PGON divided 24 times in PHI.
\begin{center}
Reduction of 2D structure to 1D structure.
\end{center}
Sometimes there are complicated multidimensional geometrical structures (like
honeycombs, spaghetti, etc.) which can be reduced to the overlap of several
one-dimensional patterns (for which divisions can be used or virtual divisions
are particularly efficient). The {\tt MANY} option allows to superimpose such 1D
structures to reproduce the multi-dimensional ones in a very effective way,
instead of positioning the volumes one by one in the 2D or 3D pattern.
The following picture will explain better this concept.


\section{Logic and algorithm}

In {\tt GTMEDI}, all the '{\tt MANY}' volumes for which the point 
is found inside (and not
in any of its daughters) is put in a stack saving also its branch of the tree.
The point is considered to be in the deepest level 
'{\tt MANY}'. Each time the point
is also found in an intermediate '{\tt ONLY}' volume the stack is 
cleared (to insure
boolean subtraction). In {\tt GTNEXT}, if stepping 
inside a '{\tt MANY}' volume, not {\tt ONLY}
its daughters and its own boundaries are checked, but also the daughters and
the boundaries of all the others '{\tt MANY}' in the 
list have to be checked. This
is not yet enough: the logic requires that the boundaries of all the possible
overlapping volumes are checked, so it is also necessary for each `{\tt MANY}' 
volume 
of the list to go up to the first '{\tt ONLY}' mother 
in the tree repeating the same 
procedure. This allows also boolean intersection. Obviously, volumes already
checked are not checked again.

\Makehead{The {\tt GEANT} shapes}
 
The {\tt GEANT} geometry package offers sixteen basic shapes with which
to describe the setups where particles are transported. In this section
we will describe these shapes. For each shape figs~(\ref{fg:geom050-1}),
(\ref{fg:geom050-2}), (\ref{fg:geom050-3}), (\ref{fg:geom050-4}) 
show a simple drawing illustrating the
meaning of the parameters and the position and orientation of the
reference frame proper of that shape. A description of the shapes and of
their parameters follows. Angles are always in degrees. With every shape is
given the code which is used internally by {\tt GEANT} to identify it.

\end{enumerate}

\item[4  TRAP] {\it general} trapezoid: the
faces perpendicular to z are trapezia and their centres are not necessarily
on a line parallel to the z axis. This shape has 11 parameters, but only 
considering that the faces should be planar, only 9 are really independent.
A check is performed on the user parameters and a message is printed in
case of non-planar faces. Ignoring this warning may cause unpredictable
effect at tracking time.

\end{enumerate}

\item[11  PGON] {\it polygon}. It has at least 10 parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt PHI1} the azimuthal angle $\phi$ at which the volume {\it begins}
(angles are counted counterclockwise);
\item {\tt DPHI} {\it opening} angle of the volume, which extends from
{\tt PHI1} to {\tt PHI1+DPHI};
\item {\tt NPDV} number of sides of the cross section between the
given $\phi$ limits;
\item {\tt NZ} number of planes perpendicular to the z axis where the
dimension of the section is given -- this number should be at least
2 and {\tt NP} triplets of numbers must follow;
\item {\tt Z} z coordinate of the section;
\item {\tt RMIN} radius of the circle tangent to the sides of the inner
polygon in the cross-section;
\item {\tt RMAX} radius of the circle tangent to the sides of the outer
polygon in the cross-section;
\end{enumerate}

(angles are counted counterclockwise);
\item {\tt DPHI} {\it opening} angle of the volume, which extends from

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt P1} semi-axis of the ellipse along x;
\item {\tt P2} semi-axis of the ellipse along y;
\item {\tt DZ} half-length in z;
\end{enumerate}

The equation of the surface is $x^2\mbox{\tt P1}^{-2} + y^2
\mbox{\tt P2}^{-2} = 1$.

\item[14 HYPE] hyperbolic  tube, i.e. the inner and  outer surfaces are
hyperboloids, as would be formed by a system of cylindrical
wires  which were  then  rotated  tangentially about  their
centres. It has  4  parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt RMIN} inner radius at the extremities;
\item {\tt RMAX} outer radius at the extremities;
\item {\tt DZ} half-length in z;
\item {\tt THET} {\it stereo  angle} of rotation of the two faces;
\end{enumerate}

The hyperbolic  surfaces are  given by: $r^2 = (z \tan \theta )^2
+r_{z=0}^2$

\item[28  GTRA] general twisted trapezoid: the
faces perpendicular to z are trapezia and their centres are not necessarily
on a line parallel to the z axis as the {\tt TRAP}; additionally, the
faces may be {\it twisted} so that none of their edges are parallel. 
It is a {\tt TRAP} shape, except that it is {\it twisted}
in the x-y plane as a function of z. 
The parallel sides perpendicular to the z axis
are rotated with respect to the x axis by an angle {\tt
TWIST}, which is one of the parameters. The shape is defined by the eight
corners and is assumed to be constructed of straight lines joining points on
the boundary of the trapezoidal face at z=-DZ to the corresponding points on the
face at z=DZ. Divisions are not allowed.  It has 12 parameters: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt DZ} half-length along the z axis;
\item {\tt THET} polar angle of the line joining the centre of the
face at {\tt -DZ} to the centre of the one at {\tt +DZ};
\item {\tt PHI} azimuthal angle of the line joining the centre of the
face at {\tt -DZ} to the centre of the one at {\tt +DZ};
\item {\tt TWIST} {\it twist} angle of the faces parallel to the x-y plane
at z = $\pm${\tt DZ} around an axis parallel to z passing through their
centre;
\item {\tt H1} half-length along y of the face at {\tt -DZ};
\item {\tt BL1} half-length along x of the side at {\tt -H1}
in y of the face at {\tt -DZ} in z;
\item {\tt TL1} half-length along x of the side at {\tt +H1}
in y of the face at {\tt -DZ} in z;
\item {\tt ALP1} angle with respect to the y axis from the centre
of the side at {\tt -H1} in y to the centre 
of the side at {\tt +H1} in y of the face at {\tt -DZ} in z;
\item {\tt H2} half-length along y of the face at {\tt +DZ};
\item {\tt BL2} half-length along x of the side at {\tt -H2}
in y of the face at {\tt +DZ} in z;
\item {\tt TL2} half-length along x of the side at {\tt +H2}
in y of the face at {\tt +DZ} in z;
\item {\tt ALP2} angle with respect to the y axis from the centre
of the side at {\tt -H2} in y to the centre 
of the side at {\tt +H2} in y of the face at {\tt +DZ} in z;
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Note:} this shape suffers from the same limitations than the {\tt TRAP}:
the tracking routines assume that the faces are planar, but this constraint
is not easily expressed in terms of the 12 parameters. Additionally, no check
on the faces is performed in this case. Users should avoid to use this shape
as much as possible, and if they have to do so, they should make sure that the
faces are really planes. If this is not the case, the result of the transport
is unpredictable.

To accelerate the computations necessary for transport, 18 additional 
parameters are calculated for this shape:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt DX0DZ} $dx/dz$ of the line joining the centres of the faces at 
z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt DY0DZ} $dy/dz$ of the line joining the centres of the faces at 
z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt X01} x at z=0 for line joining the
+ on parallel side, perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt Y01} y at z=0 for line joining the
+ on parallel side, + on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt DXDZ1} $dx/dz$ for line joining the + on parallel side,
+ on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt DYDZ1} $dy/dz$ for line joining the + on parallel side,
+ on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt X02} x at z=0 for line joining the - on parallel side,
+ on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt Y02} y at z=0 for line joining the - on parallel side,
+ on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt DXDZ2} $dx/dz$ for line joining the - on parallel side,
+ on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt DYDZ2} $dy/dz$ for line joining the - on parallel side, 
+ on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt X03} x at z=0 for line joining the - on parallel side,
- on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt Y03} y at z=0 for line joining the - on parallel side,
- on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt DXDZ3} $dx/dz$ for line joining the - on parallel side,
- on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt DYDZ3} $dy/dz$ for line joining the - on parallel side,
- on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt X04} x at z=0 for line joining the + on parallel side,
- on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt Y04} y at z=0 for line joining the + on parallel side,
- on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt DXDZ4} $dx/dz$ for line joining the + on parallel side,
- on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\item {\tt DYDZ4} $dy/dz$ for line joining the + on parallel side,
- on perpendicular corners at z=$\pm${\tt DZ};
\end{enumerate}

\item[29 CTUB] {\it cut} tube, a tube cut at the extremities with planes
not necessarily perpendicular to the z axis. It has 11 parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt RMIN} inside radius;
\item {\tt RMAX} outside radius;
\item {\tt DZ} half length in z;
\item {\tt PHI1} starting angle of the segment;
\item {\tt PHI2} ending angle of the segment;
\item {\tt LX} x component of a unit vector perpendicular to the face at {\tt -DZ};
\item {\tt LY} y component of a unit vector perpendicular to the face at {\tt -DZ};
\item {\tt LZ} z component of a unit vector perpendicular to the face at {\tt -DZ};
\item {\tt HX} x component of a unit vector perpendicular to the face at {\tt +DZ};
\item {\tt HY} y component of a unit vector perpendicular to the face at {\tt +DZ};
\item {\tt HZ} z component of a unit vector perpendicular to the face at {\tt +DZ};
\end{enumerate}
{\tt PHI1} should be smaller than {\tt PHI2}. If this is not the case,
the system adds 360 degrees to {\tt PHI2}.

\Makehead{Creation of a volume}
 
\Shubr{GSVOLU}{(CHNAME,CHSHAP,NMED,PAR,NPAR,IVOLU*)}
Defines a volume with a given name, shape, tracking medium number
and shape parameters.

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME]  ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) volume name -- it must be unique;
\item[CHSHAP] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) name of one of the {\tt GEANT} shapes;
\item[NMED]  ({\tt INTEGER}) tracking medium number for the volume --
if other volumes are positioned within this one, their tracking medium
replaces the one of the mother;
\item[PAR]   ({\tt REAL}) array containing the shape parameters;
\item[NPAR]  ({\tt INTEGER}) number of parameters -- if zero, then the
volume must be positioned via the routine \Rind{GSPOSP} indicating
the parameters for each copy (see {\tt [GEOM120]});
\item[IVOLU] ({\tt INTEGER}) internal volume number -- if $\leq 0$
an error condition has happened.
\end{DLtt}
 
If one of the parameters expressing a length is negative,
{\tt GEANT} will try to maximise its value in each copy, without
extending beyond the limits of the mother. This
facility can be used in conjunction with the
division of volumes using \Rind{GSDVN}, \Rind{GSDVT}, and \Rind{GSDVX}.
Restriction apply to this facility:
\begin{itemize}
\item the daughter should be positioned without a rotation matrix;
\item all shapes can be positioned within a similar shape with negative
parameters, but only in the centre of the mother;
\item boxes with negative parameters can be positioned in: box, {\tt TRD1},
{\tt TRD2} and {\tt TRAP} with $\theta = \phi = 0$;
\item {\tt HYPE}, {\tt ELTU} and {\tt CTUB} cannot have negative parameters;
\item {\tt PCON} and {\tt PGON} can only have 2 z planes.
\end{itemize}
{\bf Examples}
\begin{verbatim}
      DIMENSION PECAL(3)
      DATA PECAL/1.71,4.,0.2/
 
      CALL GSVOLU('ECAL','BOX ',1,PECAL,3,IVOLU)
\end{verbatim}
\Shubr{GPVOLU}{(IVOLU)}
Prints the volume parameters:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[IVOLU]  ({\tt INTEGER}) {\tt GEANT} number of the volume to print -- if
{\tt IVOLU} $\leq 0$, all volumes will be printed;
\end{DLtt}

\Makehead{Positioning a volume inside its mother}

\Shubr{GSPOS}{(CHNAME,NR,CHMOTH,X,Y,Z,IROT,CHONLY)}
Places a copy of a volume previously defined by a call to \Rind{GSVOLU} 
inside its mother volume {\tt CHMOTH}.

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) name of the volume being positioned;
\item[NR] ({\tt INTEGER}) copy number of the volume {\tt CHNAME} being 
positioned;
\item[CHMOTH]({\tt CHARACTER*4}) name of the volume in which copy
{\tt NR} of {\tt CHNAME} is positioned;
\item[X] ({\tt REAL}) x position of the volume in the mother reference system;
\item[Y] ({\tt REAL}) y position of the volume in the mother reference system;
\item[Z] ({\tt REAL}) z position of the volume in the mother reference system;
\item[IROT] ({\tt INTEGER}) rotation matrix number
describing the orientation of the volume relative to
the coordinate system of the mother;
\item[CHONLY] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) flag to indicate whether
a point found to be in this volume may also be in other volumes which
are not direct descendants of it -- possible values are {\tt ONLY} and
{\tt MANY}.
\end{DLtt}

The following points are important for a correct use of \Rind{GSPOS}:
\begin{itemize}
\item the position and rotation with which a volume is positioned are
relative to the mother reference system, that is to the reference system
of the volume which contains the copy being positioned. To see how the
reference system is defined for the {\tt GEANT} shapes, see {\tt [GEOM050]};
\item 
\Rind{GSPOS} can be called several times with the same name, to place 
multiple copies of the same volume either in the
same mother volume or in different ones.
The copy number parameter {\tt NR} is user defined, and it allows
the different copies of the same volume to be distinguished. The user is
free to assign any valid integer to this parameter. If two volumes
are positioned with the same copy number, it will be impossible to decide
in which one a particle is during tracking. If the same volume is positioned
twice inside the same mother with the same copy number, the parameters
of the second call to \Rind{GSPOS} will override the first ones for that
copy;
\item all the copies of a volume are identical: in particular they contain
all the same daughters recursively -- conversely, positioning a volume 
inside a mother will insert it in all the copies of that mother;
\item the volumes mentioned in the call must be already defined by a call
to \Rind{GSVOLU};
\item no volume can be positioned in a divided mother;
\item in case of positioning without rotation, {\tt IROT} should be set
to 0 -- note that this is faster than defining a unit matrix;
\item the first volume, containing all the apparatus, cannot be positioned;
\item if the {\tt CHONLY} flag is equal to {\tt ONLY}, the volume being
positioned should not overlap with any other volume except his mother
and his daughters and should not extend beyond the limits of its mother. 
In this case the search routines assume that, when a point
is found in this volume, the only further searching required is in its contents.
Other volumes at the same or higher levels
or in separate branches will not be looked at. The first volume must be 
{\tt ONLY};
\item if the {\tt CHONLY} flag is set to {\tt MANY}, a point found in
this volume can also be in another volume at the same or higher level or in
a different branch of the tree. To decide where a point is the following
algorithm is applied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the tree is scanned {\it upward} until an {\tt ONLY} mother
with {\it positioned} contents (i.e. non-divided) is found;
\item all the branches of the tree descending from this volume are
scanned to find other volumes where the point may be;
\item a winner is selected among the candidates according to the
following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item if one of the candidates is {\tt ONLY}, the point is declared in this
volume. If more than one candidate is {\tt ONLY} there is an error in the
geometry definition;
\item amongst several {\tt MANY} candidates, the one at the deepest level
is chosen;
\item amongst several {\tt MANY} candidates at the same level, the first one
found is chosen;
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Although a considerable effort has been put in making sure that the {\tt MANY}
option works properly and caters for all the possible cases, still it introduces
a considerable complication in the tracking and performance can be
rather poor.

Users should resort to this only when it is not possible to describe the
experimental setup with {\tt ONLY} volumes.
\end{itemize}

The data structure is so designed that, in any case, the parameters
of a volume and the information about the number and position of
its daughters are stored only once. This allows the creation of
very complex geometries without correspondingly large storage
requirements.

\Makehead{Positioning a volume inside its mother with parameters}

Position a copy of volume {\tt CHNAME} inside its mother {\tt CHMOTH}
assigning its parameters.

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) name of the volume being positioned;
\item[NR] ({\tt INTEGER}) copy number of the volume {\tt CHNAME} being

\item[NPAR] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of parameters.
\end{DLtt}

It is often the case in a detector to have a family of similar objects,
differing only by their dimensions. A typical example are the crystals of
an electromagnetic calorimeter. In this case it is convenient and logically
consistent to give them all the same name, but assign to each copy a different
set of parameters.

This can be done defining the volume with 0 parameters through the routine
\Rind{GSVOLU} and then assigning the parameters to each copy via the routine
\Rind{GSPOSP}.

\Rind{GSPOSP} is similar in all other aspects to \Rind{GSPOS} and the user is
referred to the description of this routine for more information. An obvious
limitation is that a volume defined with 0 parameters can only be positioned
via \Rind{GSPOSP}, because otherwise its dimensions will be undefined.

\Makehead{Division of a volume into a given number of cells}

\Shubr{GSDVN}{(CHNAME,CHMOTH,NDIV,IAXIS)}

Divide a volume in a given number of parts along a direction. 

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) a unique name for the volume to be generated
by subdivision of the mother volume;
\item[CHMOTH] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) volume that has to be subdivided;
\item[NDIV] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of divisions into which the mother volume 
is to be divided;
\item[IAXIS] ({\tt INTEGER}) {\it axis} of the division.
\end{DLtt}

The volumes resulting from a division are true volumes in
the {\tt GEANT} sense, with the only limitation that they cannot be
positioned. They can have daughters and they can still be divided in turn.
Different divisions are distinguished by a different division number,
much the same as different copy of the same volume by the copy number.
Every operation performed on a division cell (positioning or further division),
is automatically propagated to all divisions cells of the same mother.

The kind of the division is indicated by the {\tt IAXIS} argument. The
allowed values of {\tt IAXIS} and the resulting divisions are shown in
figs. \ref{fg:geom130-1}, \ref{fg:geom130-2}, \ref{fg:geom130-3}, 
\ref{fg:geom130-4}. The
basic constraint imposed by the {\tt GEANT} geometry is that the result
of a division is a volume which can be described in terms of the basic 
shapes.

The local coordinate system of the divisions is parallel to the
system of the mother in case of divisions obtained by parallel planes or
concentric divisions. In the case of parallel axes the coordinate system
is shifted so that it is in the centre of the division.
In case of $\phi$ divisions produced by planes
passing through the axis of a volume with axial symmetry ({\tt TUBE, TUBS,
CONE, CONS, PGON, PCON, SPHE}), the local coordinate systems will be 
rotated so that the x axis passes through the centre of the division.

This routine allows the user to generate a large number of identical
volumes filling a defined volume. The material of the slices is inherited
from the mother.

It may happen that the different divisions of a volume have different
dimensions. In this case, if a volume has to be positioned in each division, 
its dimensions must be different according to the division number. This can
be obtained in some special cases giving to the dimension of the
volume which has to vary in order to fit into the different mothers,
the value of -1 in the call to
\Rind{GSVOLU} which defines it. As explained in {\tt [GEOM050]}, {\tt GEANT}
will take care to assign to this dimension the maximum value in order to
fill the current mother.

What can be done with division can be done also, in most cases, explicitly
positioning all the copies. Users must be aware, however, that divisions
offer the best performance in tracking of all {\tt GEANT} geometrical
constructs, and they should be used instead of positioning whenever
possible in the definition of objects.

\end{DLtt}

For more information on the division mechanism, see {\tt [GEOM130]} and
{\tt [GEOM140]}. For the moment either
{\tt NDIV} or {\tt STEP} must be set negative or 0, so that they
will be computed from the {\tt CHMOTH}'s size.
The case with both {\tt NDIV} and {\tt STEP}
positive is not coded yet. It would permit leaving different
gaps at both ends of the
{\tt CHMOTH}.

Provisionally the code consists of a call to either \Rind{GSDVN2} or
\Rind{GSDVT2}.

\Shubr{GSDVN2}{(CHNAME,CHMOTH,NDIV,IAXIS,C0,NUMED)}

Divide a volume in a given number of parts along a direction, 
starting from an offset.

portion of the mother undivided (see below) --
if {\tt NUMED} $\leq 0$  the medium of the mother;
\end{DLtt}

The divisions start at the user specified coordinate value
and extend to the end of the volume. The range from this offset to
the upper coordinate limit of the mother volume will be divided
into the supplied number of cells. 
In the case of 
$\phi$ division of a complete tube or cone, the whole 360 degrees
will be divided into the user-supplied number of slices no matter
what the origin is. Specifying an origin for the division, in this
case, just moves the
division boundaries. This can be useful to avoid a rotation.
In all other cases the search routines will
assume that a point is in the mother if the coordinate value is
less than the value of the supplied offset.

\Shubr{GSDVT2}{(CHNAME,CHMOTH,STEP,IAXIS,C0,NUMED,NDVMX)}

Divide a volume along a direction with a given step starting from an offset.

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) a unique name for the volume to be generated
by subdivision of the mother volume;
\item[CHMOTH] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) volume that has to be subdivided;

\item[NDVMX] ({\tt INTEGER}) expected (maximum) number of divisions -- if
$ \leq 0 $ or $ > 255 $, 255 is assumed.
\end{DLtt}

The division start at the user-specified coordinate value
and extend to the end of the volume. The range from origin to
upper coordinate limit of the mother volume is divided
in sections of the user supplied step. If the step is such that
the range of the mother cannot be filled with cells, the largest
possible number of cells is created.
The excess space up to the end
of the mother volume will be assumed to belong to the mother.

In the case of 
$\phi$ division of a complete tube or cone, the whole 360 degrees
will be filled with slices, no matter
what the origin is. Specifying an origin for the division, in this
case, just moves the
division boundaries. This can be useful to avoid a rotation.

In all other cases the search routines will
assume a point is just in the mother if the coordinate value is
less than the value of the user supplied origin.

\Makehead{Rotation matrices}

The relative position of a volume inside its mother is expressed in
{\tt GEANT} by a translation vector and a rotation matrix which are 
arguments of the routines \Rind{GSPOS} and \Rind{GSPOSP}. The rotation
matrix expresses the transformation from the {\tt M}other {\tt R}eference
{\tt S}ystem to the {\tt D}aughter {\tt R}eference {\tt S}ystem.

A rotation matrix is described to {\tt GEANT} by giving the polar and
azimuthal angles of the axes of the {\tt DRS} ($x', y', z'$) in the
{\tt MRS} via the routine \Rind{GSROTM}.

\Shubr{GSROTM}{(IROT,THETA1,PHI1,THETA2,PHI2,THETA3,PHI3)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[IROT] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the rotation matrix;
\item[THETA1] ({\tt REAL}) polar angle for axis $x'$;
\item[PHI1] ({\tt REAL}) azimuthal angle for axis $x'$;
\item[THETA2] ({\tt REAL}) polar angle for axis $y'$;
\item[THI2] ({\tt REAL}) azimuthal angle for axis $y'$;
\item[THETA3] ({\tt REAL}) polar angle for axis $z'$;
\item[PHI3] ({\tt REAL}) azimuthal angle for axis $z'$.
\end{DLtt}
Stores rotation matrix {\tt IROT} in the data structure {\tt JROTM}. If the
matrix is not orthonormal, it will be corrected by setting $y' \perp x'$ and
then $z' = x' \times y'$. A warning message is printed in this case.

{\bf Note:}
the angles {\tt THETA} and {\tt PHI} must be given in degrees.
 
\section*{Examples of use}
The unit matrix is defined in the following way:

\[
\left . \begin{array}{lcl}
x' & \| & x \\
y' & \| & y \\
z' & \| & z
\end{array} \right \}
\Rightarrow
\left \{
\begin{array}{lcr@{\mbox{\hspace{3mm};\hspace{8mm}}}lcr}
\theta_1 & = & 90^{\circ} & \phi_1 & = & 0^{\circ} \\
\theta_2 & = & 90^{\circ} & \phi_2 & = & 90^{\circ} \\
\theta_3 & = & 0^{\circ} & \phi_3 & = & 0^{\circ} 
\end{array} \right .
\]

This is just an example. There is in fact no need to define a unit rotation
matrix. Giving the value 0 to the rotation matrix number in the call to
\Rind{GSPOS} and \Rind{GSPOSP} is equivalent to a positioning without 
rotation and it improves tracking performance.

The result of a $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation around $z$, followed
by a $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation around the new $x$ is a cyclic
shift of the axes: $x \rightarrow z', \; y \rightarrow x', \; z \rightarrow  
y'$. This is expressed by the following rotation matrix:

\[
\left . \begin{array}{lcl}
x' & \| & y \\
y' & \| & z \\
z' & \| & x
\end{array} \right \}
\Rightarrow
\left \{
\begin{array}{lcr@{\mbox{\hspace{3mm};\hspace{8mm}}}lcr}
\theta_1 & = & 90^{\circ} & \phi_1 & = & 90^{\circ} \\
\theta_2 & = & 0^{\circ} & \phi_2 & = & 0^{\circ} \\
\theta_3 & = & 90^{\circ} & \phi_3 & = & 0^{\circ} 
\end{array} \right .
\]

Sometimes the rotation matrix is known or it can be constructed. In this case
the arguments to the routine \Rind{GSROTM} can be calculated with the help
of the routine \Rind{GFANG} in the following way:

\begin{verbatim}
      DIMENSION ROTMAT(3,3), ROWMAT(3), PHI(3), THETA(3)
      LOGICAL ROTATE
      .
      .
      .
      DO 10 I=1,3
         ROWMAT(1) = ROTMAT(I,1)
         ROWMAT(2) = ROTMAT(I,2)
         ROWMAT(3) = ROTMAT(I,3)
         CALL GFANG(ROWMAT,COSTH,SINTH,COSPH,SINPH,ROTATE)
         THETA(I) = ATAN2(SINTH,COSTH)
         PHI(I)   = ATAN2(SINPH,COSPH)
  10  CONTINUE
      CALL GSROTM(IROT,THETA(1),PHI(1),THETA(2),PHI(2),THETA(3),PHI(3))
\end{verbatim}
 
\Shubr{GPROTM}{(IROT)}
Prints the rotation matrix elements and angles.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[IROT]  ({\tt INTEGER}) rotation matrix number: if {\tt IROT}=0 all
rotation matrixes will be printed, if {\tt IROT}$<$0, matrix number
{\tt |IROT|} will be printed without header information.
\end{DLtt}

\Makehead{Finding in which volume a point is}

\Shubr{GMEDIA}{(X,NUMED*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[X] ({\tt REAL}) array of dimension 3 with the coordinates in the 
{\tt MRS};
\item[NUMED] ({\tt INTEGER}) medium number, if this is zero the point is 
outside the detector.
\end{DLtt}

Searches the geometrical tree structure to find in which volume the point 
{\tt X} is. The tracking medium is returned in {\tt NUMED}, and the common 
\FCind{/GCVOLU/} is updated.
 
\Rind{GMEDIA} uses the geometry data structure to conduct its search
starting its search from the last volume where a point was found.
If no previous search has been conducted, the first volume is used
as a starting point.

If the point is not inside the current volume, \Rind{GMEDIA} looks in its 
mother and so on, until it finds a volume which contains the point.
It then looks at the contents of this object and so on until the point 
is in a volume but in none of its contents (if any).

If this {\it downward} search terminates in a
{\tt 'MANY'} object, \Rind{GMEDIA} looks for another candidate. See
{\tt [GEOM110]} for a description of the {\tt `MANY'} volumes tratment.

The {\it physical} geometrical tree from the first volume
to the current one is stored in the common block \FCind{GCVOLU}
(see {\tt [BASE030]}) and in the structure {\tt JGPAR} (see {\tt [GEOM199]}).

\Shubr{GTMEDI}{(X,NUMED*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[X] ({\tt REAL}) array of dimension 3 with the coordinates in the 
{\tt MRS};
\item[NUMED] ({\tt INTEGER}) medium number, if this is zero the point is 
outside the detector.
\end{DLtt}

This routine performs the same function than \Rind{GMEDIA}, but it uses
the dynamical information of the particle history to speed-up the 
search:
\begin{itemize}
\item when {\tt INWVOL=2} (common \FCind{/GCTRAK/})
the particle just came out of a volume. In this
case, if {\tt INFROM} (common \FCind{/GCVOLU/}) is positive, it is
interpreted by \Rind{GTMEDI} as the number {\tt IN} of the content
just left, inside the mother volume
where the point {\tt X} is assumed to be. This content will not be
searched again.
\item the daughter of the current volume which limits the
geometrical step of the particle (i.e. where the particle would be heading
moving along a straight line) is searched first.
{\tt INGOTO} (common \FCind{/GCVOLU/}) is set by \Rind{GTNEXT}, to transmit 
the information
on this one volume which has limited the geometrical step {\tt SNEXT} as follows:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[$>$0] {\tt IN}$^{th}$ content;
\item[$=$0] current volume;
\item[$<$0] -{\tt NLONLY}, with {\tt NLONLY} defined as the lowest {\tt 'ONLY'}
level up in the tree which is an ancestor of the {\tt 'MANY'} volume 
where the point {\tt X} is.
\end{DLtt}
\end{itemize}

\Shubr{GINVOL}{(X,ISAME*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[X] ({\tt REAL}) array of dimension 3 with the coordinates in the 
{\tt MRS};
\item[ISAME] ({\tt INTEGER}) return flag.
\end{DLtt}
Checks if particle at point {\tt X} has left current volume.
If so, returns {\tt ISAME = 0} and prepares information useful to
identify the new volume entered, otherwise, returns {\tt ISAME = 1}.

\Makehead{Finding distance to next boundary}

\Shubr{GNEXT}{(X,SNEXT*,SAFETY*)}
\Shubr{GTNEXT}{(X,SNEXT*,SAFETY*)}
Finds distance to the next boundary.
It takes explicit account of shape content and uniqueness.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[X] ({\tt REAL}) array of 6 of coordinates and direction cosines;
\item[SNEXT] ({\tt REAL}) distance to the nearest volume boundary 
along the particle direction;
\item[SAFETY] ({\tt REAL}) {\it safety} distance, that is smaller distance
to any boundary;
\end{DLtt}
 
This routine evaluates the two {\it distances} which are needed by the
{\tt GEANT} tracking routines. \Rind{GTNEXT} and \Rind{GNEXT} perform
the same function, but \Rind{GNEXT} is a static routine which can be
called by the user, while \Rind{GTNEXT} is the routines used internally
by {\tt GEANT} during tracking, and it should not be called by the user.

If {\tt INFROM} (common \FCind{/GCVOLU/}) is different from 0, \Rind{GTNEXT}
interprets it as the daughter out of which the particle just came, and
uses the list of daughters stored with that volume, possibly modified by
\Rind{GSNEXT}/\Rind{GSNEAR} to calculate the distance to the next boundary.

The first action of \Rind{GTNEXT} is to calculate the {\tt SAFETY} distance.
If this is larger than the current step candidate, no other calculation is
performed and the {\tt IGNEXT} flag (common \FCind{/GCTRAK/}) is set to 0,
indicating that no change of volume is occurring at the end of the current
step. If the step is smaller than safety, then {\tt SNEXT} is computed.
If the step is smaller than {\tt SNEXT}, again there will not be any
change of volume during the step and {\tt IGNEXT} is set to 0.
If on the contrary the candidate step is larger than {\tt SNEXT}, a
change of volume will occur at the end of the step, and {\tt IGNEXT}
is set to 1 and {\tt INGOTO} (common \FCind{/GCTRAK/}) is set to the
number of the daughter where the particle is entering, if any.

Charged particles in magnetic field are transported with a similar logic.
However, even if the candidate step is smaller than {\tt SNEXT}, the
particle can still cross into another volume due to its bent path. When
tracking in magnetic field, after every step greater than {\tt SAFETY}
it is checked whether the particle is still in the same volume. If this is
not the case, the step is divided by two and transport is tried again.
Conversely a charged particle in magnetic field may still be in the
current volume even after having travelled the distance to the nearest
boundary along a {\it straight} line. So boundary crossing is declared
only when {\tt IGNEXT} is different from 0 and 
the difference between the real trajectory and the bent one is smaller
than {\tt EPSIL} (common \FCind{/GCTMED/}).

\Makehead{Pseudo-division of a volume}

\Shubr{GSORD}{(CHNAME,ICORD)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME]  ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) name of the volume;
\item[ICORD]  ({\tt INTEGER}) direction of the pseudo-divisions:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[1] $x$;
\item[2] $y$;
\item[3] $z$;
\item[4] cylindrical $R$ ($\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$);

\item[6] $\phi$, azimuthal angle;
\item[7] $\theta$, polar angle with respect to the $z$ axis.
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}

This routine sets the search flag ({\tt Q(JVO+1)}) of volume {\tt CHNAME} 
to {\tt -ICORD}. When the definition of the geometry is complete and 
\Rind{GGCLOS} is called, this flag is interpreted as a request to order 
the content
of {\tt CHNAME} along {\it axis} {\tt ICORD}. This operation is 
performed by the routine \Rind{GGORD}.
\Rind{GGORD} computes the limits of each of the contents along the given
coordinate axis (see {\tt [GEOM001]}),
and prepares the lists of contents in each of the sections
defined by the neighbouring coordinate. The {\tt JVOLUM} structure 
is extended, for
the mother volume, with banks which contains the list of boundaries and the
lists of contents, so as to permit a binary search to access the contents
of interest. The coordinates are in the local system of the mother volume.
The routine \Rind{GGORD} will not be called if the number of contents 
exceeds 500.

The actual effect of this routine depends on the setting of the {\tt IOPTIM}
variable in the common \FCind{/GCOPTI/}. {\tt IOPTIM} is controlled by the
data record {\tt OPTI} or the interactive command with the same name.
The meaning of the different values of {\tt IOPTIM} is the following:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[$<$0] no call to \Rind{GGORD} will be made, irrespective of the
value of {\tt ISEARCH};
\item[~0] \Rind{GGORD} will be called for those volumes for which \Rind{GSORD}
has been called;
\item[~1] for all volumes with contents for which neither \Rind{GUSEAR} nor
\Rind{GSORD} has been called, the routine \Rind{GGORDQ} will be called;
\item[~2] \Rind{GGORDQ} is called for all volumes with contents
for which \Rind{GUSEAR} has not been called.
\end{DLtt}
 
\Rind{GGORDQ} orders the contents along all the possible axes and choses the
ordering which provides the lowest number of volumes per division.

\Makehead{Ordering the contents of a volume}

In the case of a mother volume containing a large number of daughters,
tracking can be rather slow. This is due to the fact that each time
{\tt GEANT} requires to know in which daughter it is or will be tracking,
it search through the whole list of daughter volumes.
This is done by {\tt GEANT} creating for every daughter volume a list
which contain pointers to all the daughters of the same mother.

Clearly this may be avoided, because at any step of tracking, the 
coordinates and direction cosines of the current step are known. From this
and the knowledge of the geometry, a restricted list of daughter volumes 
to be searched can be built. This can be accomplished in {\tt GEANT} in
two ways, which are described in this chapter.

{\bf Note}: the user must be aware that the following routines alter the
default search list of daughters of a given mother. A user mistake can
cause wrong transport because {\tt GEANT} does not make any check on the
correctness of the list of neighbours provided by the user.

\section*{Static ordering}
\Shubr{GSNEXT}{(CHMOTH,IN,NLIST,LIST)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHMOTH] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) name of the mother volume to be ordered;
\item[IN]     ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the content for which a list
is established;
\item[NLIST]  ({\tt INTEGER}) number of neighbours to be considered 
during tracking;
\item[LIST]  ({\tt INTEGER}) list of neighbours to volume {\tt IN}.
\end{DLtt}

This routine stores a given ordered {\tt LIST} of {\tt NLIST} daughter
volumes to search when leaving the {\tt IN}$^{th}$ daughter
of the mother volume {\tt CHMOTH}.

If {\tt IN=0}, for each content, \Rind{GSNEXT} builds a list limited to
the contents {\tt IN+1} (if it exists), {\tt IN-1} (if it exists) and 
{\tt IN} itself.

\Shubr{GSNEAR}{(CHMOTH,IN,NLIST,LIST)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHMOTH] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) name of the mother volume to be ordered;
\item[IN]     ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the content for which a list
is established;
\item[NLIST]  ({\tt INTEGER}) number of neighbours to be considered 
during tracking;
\item[LIST]  ({\tt INTEGER}) list of neighbours to volume {\tt IN}.
\end{DLtt}

This routine stores a given ordered {\tt LIST} of {\tt NLIST} daughter
volumes to search when leaving the {\tt IN}$^{th}$ daughter
of the mother volume {\tt CHMOTH}.
 
If {\tt LIST(1)}=0 the particle is back into the mother when leaving the
{\tt IN}$^{th}$ daughter. This means that the {\tt IN}$^{th}$ is not 
contiguous to any other daughter or to the boundary of the mother.

If {\tt IN}=-1, the mother does not have contents contiguous
to its boundaries (status bit 4 set in mother volume bank for action in
\Rind{GGCLOS}).

If {\tt IN}=0 for each content \Rind{GSNEAR} sets {\tt LIST(1)}=0.

\Rind{GSNEAR} must be called after all contents have been position ( except
when {\tt IN}=-1)

\section*{Dynamic ordering}

The list of neighbours to search when exiting from the {\tt IN}$^{th}$
content may depend also on the direction and position of the particle.
In case where it is necessary, for performance reasons, to exploit also
this information, {\tt GEANT} offers the possibility to the user to 
build a dynamic search list.

\Shubr{GSUNEA}{(CHNAME,ISEARC)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHNAME] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) name of the volume where the user search
has to be activated;
\item[ISEARCH] ({\tt INTEGER}) specifies the kind of search list to
be used: a positive value must be specified with this routine to activate
user search lists.
\end{DLtt}
This routine should be called once for every volume where user volume
search is activated.

\Shubr{GUNEAR}{(ISEARC,ICALL,XC,JNEAR)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[ISEARCH] ({\tt INTEGER}) number associated to the volume in which
the user search is used, it is the same number set by the user with
\Rind{GSUNEA};
\item[ICALL] ({\tt INTEGER}) type of question that the list of volumes
must answer:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[1] \Rind{GMEDIA}-like call, where am I?
\item[2] \Rind{GTNEXT}-like call, where can I go?
\end{DLtt}
\item[XC] ({\tt REAL}) array of 6 containing the position and the
direction cosines of the particle ($x$, $y$, $z$, $p_x/p$, $p_y/p$, $p_x/p$);
\item[JNEAR] ({\tt INTEGER}) pointer to the volume list bank which has
to be filled by the user;
\end{DLtt}

The list of volumes where {\tt GEANT} has to search to answer the question
specified by {\tt ICALL} is returned by the user starting at {\tt Q(JNEAR+1}.
{\tt GEANT} will only look at the volumes specified by the user and in
the order in which they appear in the list. Daughters are numbered from 1
to N according to the order with which they have been positioned in the
mother. The list should be filled in the following way:

\begin{tabular}{lcp{7cm}}
{\tt IQ(JNEAR+1)} & = & {\tt N}, number of volumes in the list \\
{\tt IQ(JNEAR+1+1)} & = & number of the first daughter to search \\
{\tt IQ(JNEAR+1+2)} & = & number of the second daughter to search \\
.\\
.\\
.\\
{\tt IQ(JNEAR+1+N)} & = & number of the N$^{th}$ daughter to search 
\end{tabular}

The user should be aware that this routine is called very often, almost
at every tracking step, so it should be coded with the maximum efficiency
in mind.  An example of \Rind{GUNEAR} could be the following:

\begin{verbatim}
      SUBROUTINE GUNEAR(ISEARC,ICALL,XC,JNEAR)
*---              Make sure to add GEANT main store
+SEQ, GCBANK.

*---              Executable code
      IF(ISEARC.EQ.1) THEN
*---              Build a list using XC and ISEARC for a GMEDIA type call
*---              Put all the daughters where the particle may be in
         MYLIST(1) = ....
         .
         .
         .
         MYLIST(N) = ....
      ELSE 
*---              Build a list using XC and ISEARC for a GTNEXT type call
*---              Put all the daughters where the particle may be going
         MYLIST(1) = ....
         .
         .
         .
         MYLIST(N) = ....
      ENDIF
*---              Return the information to GEANT
      DO 10 I=1,N
         IQ(JNEAR+1+I) = MYLIST(I)
  10  CONTINUE
      IQ(JNEAR+1) = N
*---              End of GUNEAR
      END
\end{verbatim}

\Makehead{User initialisation of the common block {\tt /GCVOLU/}}

\Shubr{GLVOLU}{(NLEV,LNAM,LNUM,IER*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMM}
\item[NLEV] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of levels to fill;
\item[LNAM] ({\tt INTEGER}) array of {\tt NLEV} volume names stored
via the \Rind{UCTOH} routine;
\item[LNUM] ({\tt INTEGER}) array of {\tt NLEV} volume copy (or 
division) numbers;
\item[IER] ({\tt INTEGER}) returns code different from 0 in case of 
error, a diagnostic is also printed;
\end{DLtt}

This routine fills the volume parameters in common \FCind{/GCVOLU/}
for a physical tree, specified by the lists {\tt LNAM} and {\tt LNUM} of
volumes names and numbers, and for all its ascendants up to
level 1.

The routine is optimised and does not re-compute the part of
history already available in \FCind{GCVOLU}. This means that if
it is used in user programs outside the usual framework of the tracking,
the user has to initialise to zero {\tt NLEVEL} in common \FCind{GCVOLU}.

An example of use of \Rind{GLVOLU} in this context could be to find the
position and direction of a particle in the local coordinate system of
a volume:
\begin{verbatim}
      .

\Makehead{Medium search statistics}

In order to understand the behaviour and the performance of the 
geometry defined by the user, it is sometimes very useful to
accumulate the statistic of the various geometrical routines called.
This is done automatically by {\tt GEANT} if the statistical package
is activated via the data record {\tt STAT 1}. In this case the routine
\Rind{GBSTAT} is called by \Rind{GGCLOS}, \Rind{GFSTAT} is called by
the tracking routines \Rind{GINVOL}, \Rind{GTMEDI}, \Rind{GTNEXT},
\Rind{GTRACK} and \Rind{GMEDIA} to accumulate the statistics and \Rind{GPSTAT}
is called by \Rind{GLAST}.

\Shubr{GBSTAT}{}
Creates the data structure {\tt JGSTAT} in order to accumulate
statistics for the number of calls to routines
\Rind{GINVOL}, \Rind{GTMEDI}, \Rind{GTNEXT},
\Rind{GTRACK} and \Rind{GMEDIA}
and the total number of steps per volume.

\Shubr{GPSTAT}{}
Prints the volume statistics accumulated during the run. The
table which is printed is useful for optimizing the tracking
medium parameters associated to each volume.

\Shubr{GFSTAT}{}
Fills banks for volume statistics.
 
An example of output is the following:

\begin{center}

This routine should be called after all volumes, positions,
hits and digits have been defined. Its action is confined to
clean up the volume banks and to take any action required by the
ordering techniques. 

\Rind{GGCLOS} performs all the requested geometry optimisation, included
the creation of pseudo-divisions in volumes flagged by \Rind{GSORD}.
It performs the local development of tha last leaves of the
geometrical tree, where applicable.

It also calls the routine \Rind{GGDETV} which prepares the prototype lists of
volume names and maximum multiplicities which permit to identify uniquely
any sensitive detector whose generic name has been declared through the
routine \Rind{GSDETV} (and not \Rind{GSDET}) {\tt [HITS001]}.

\Rind{GGCLOS} must be called also after reading a geometry data structure

\Makehead{GEANT-SET interface CADINT 1.20}

\section{Introduction}
CADINT converts {\tt GEANT} detector geometries into the SET\footnote
{{\it Standard
d'Echange et de Transfert}, a French standard for exchange of CAD/CAM data}
file format.
The detector geometries can be read into
EUCLID-IS (or other CAD-systems with a proper
SET interface) using SET file format.
 
A {\tt GEANT} detector geometry exported through CADINT
into a CAD-system can be used to
check the coherence of the model used in simulation.
The CADDFAS service at CERN can be used to convert SET files into IGES
\footnote{{\it Initial Graphics Exchange Specification}, an American
standard for exchange of CAD-data} format, which is readable
by most CAD-systems.
For more information about the CADDFAS service, send a mail to {\it
caddfas@cadd.cern.ch} with subject: {\it info}

\section{The CADINT Command:}
 
The command ``CADINT'' invokes subroutine GTXSET:
 
\Shubr{GTXSET}{(FNAME,ANAME,NBINS,LUNIT,LUNIT2,INST,SITE,DEPT,RESP)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item [FNAME] Name of the SET file;
\item [ANAME] Name of the volume to start the conversion;
\item [NBINS] Number of instances of each division to be exported;
\item [LUNIT] Logical unit for the SET file;
\item [LUNI2] Logical unit for the material file;
\item [INST] Name of the institute;
\item [SITE] Name of the site;
\item [DEPT] Name of the departement;
\item [RESP] Name of the sender;
\end{DLtt}

The parameters which are related to the geometry are the volume name and the
number of instances of each division. The
other parameters are related to the SET file header and output.
 
 
Selection of volumes can be done using the visibility
attribute, the volume name and the number of
division instances.
All visible volumes and the given number of division instances
will be written into the SET file starting from the given volume.
Volume names will
be written into SET with an index to distinguish different instances
of a volume. In a case of divisions, the indexing of slices will
be reset in each division.
 
Material and tree information is written to a separate file,
with the same name as the SET file, but with extension ``.mat''.

The tree information is in computer interpretable format. After the
volume name there is the number of daughters and daughter names.
In a case of divided volumes the (negative) number of divisions is given after
the name of divided volume followed by the starting coordinate, step
and the name of the division instance.
 
 
 
\section{Some Hints}
 
In order to carry out a succesful transfer of the geometry, the user needs to be
aware of certain limitations of the interface. The user is recommended
to communicate
with the engineers using CAD systems to establish a proper transfer methodology.
 
 
\section{Size Limitations}
 
CADINT is useful to transfer parts of a detector from {\tt GEANT}
to a CAD-system.  The full detector description may be too huge
to store in the users
CAD-system, so he should be aware of some limitations.
A good strategy is to make several SET files, one for each sub-part of the
detector, and then read each file into the CAD-system at a time.
When the user exports {\tt GEANT} geometry to a CAD system, 
he should be careful not to have
too many volumes, because this will fill up the CAD system.
 
It is impossible to give an exact size-limit, because the limitation
highly depends on the structure of the detector.  Both the {\tt GEANT}-tree 
structure
and the type of volumes are important factors. In some cases the
transfer works with  more than 1000 volumes, in other cases the user
will reach the limit around 50.
An example: The CDET part of ALEPH (450 volumes) can be read into
EUCLID as one file, the SET file has a size of 140Kb.  But the COIL
part (66 volumes) of ALEPH cannot be read into EUCLID in one piece,
is has to be read in as several files, despite of the fact that the
SET file COIL.SET is only 22Kb.
 
Normally it is a good idea to just export 1 instance of each division
to limit the number of exported volumes.  If the user can limit himself to
sub-detectors of 100 volumes and less he should avoid problems. 

\section{Use of Graphics}
 
The {\tt GEANT} graphics package  provides excellent capabilities for
viewing parts of a detector which is to be exported.  By using the
DTREE and DSPEC functions, the user can simply move
around in the detector tree and look at parts of is on the screen.  By
varying the visibility attributes and the number of division instances, the
user will be able to export exactly what he needs.
 
\section{Supply Extra Information if Required}
A plot of the {\tt GEANT} tree can be useful for the engineer to understand the
structure of the {\tt GEANT} geometry.  The {\tt GEANT} 
volume names are useful references
regarding material and tree information. The tree information is also
provided in the material file, but a graphical presentation is often useful.
 
\section{Suppress Non-Relevant Volumes}
Dummy volumes, such as mothers made of air or vacuum should be suppressed (use
the visibility attribute), since the interface is currently not able to discard
 such information.
 
\section{Reset GDRAW Parameters After Use of CADINT}
The user must remember to specify the drawing parameters again if he
wants to use GDRAW to draw the detector after using the interface command.
This is because the CAD-interface uses some {\tt GDRAW} routines.

\Makehead{The detector response package}
\section{Introduction}
In the context of {\tt GEANT}:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf hit} is the user-defined {\it information} recorded at 
tracking time to keep track of the interaction between one
particle and a given detector,
and necessary to compute the digitisations later.
\item  {\bf digitisation} ({\it digit}) is the user-defined
{\tt information} simulating the response
of a given detector element, usually estimated
after tracking a complete event.
\end{itemize}
The detector response package consists of tools to store,
retrieve or print the information relevant to hits and
digitisation which is in the data structures
{\tt JSET, JHITS} and {\tt JDIGI}.
A few subroutines which may
help the user to solve some of the usual digitisation problems
in simple detectors
have been added to the package, e.g. the intersection of a
track with a plane or a cylinder
and the digitisation of conventional drift and {\tt MWP} chambers.

For complex setups with different types of detectors
the user has normally to define
several types of hits and digitisations.
In addition to the hits generated by all particles of the
current event, computing the digitisations
requires usually some information about the intrinsic
characteristics and performance of the detectors.
The information to be recorded for the hits and digitisations
is highly experiment dependent, therefore only a framework
can be proposed to store it.
 
Two remarks can be made:
\begin{itemize}
\item during the life of an experiment, 
the stability of the format and content of the information to be stored
is usually reached much earlier for the hits than for the digitisations.
Therefore the user may save computing time
by designing an intermediate event output at the hits level.
\item  the scheme proposed for storing the digitisations
should in any case be considered as
an intermediate stage, a further processing of the data being necessary
if the user wants to
simulate more closely the specific format of the real
data-acquisition system.
\end{itemize}

\section{{\tt SET}s and {\tt DET}ectors}

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the way the
geometrical setup is described ({\tt [GEOM]}), in particular
with the concepts of logical and physical volume tree structure.

The user is required to classify into sets all sensitive detectors
(defined as those volume defined as detector via \Rind{GSDET}/\Rind{GSDETV})
for which he wants to store hits in the data structure {\tt JHITS}.
The 4-character names which identify the sets are user defined,
and the list of sets
which the user wants to activate for a given run can be entered
through the data record {\tt SETS}.
The user can group together in one or in several sets
detectors of the same or different types. For convenience,
it is recommended to have at least one set for
each main component of the setup, e.g. hadronic calorimeters,
electromagnetic calorimeters, vertex chamber, etc.

A volume can be declared as a sensitive detector through the tracking
medium parameter {\tt ISVOL},
and allocated to a set through the subroutine \Rind{GSDET} or
\Rind{GSDETV}.
Each (logical) sensitive detector is identified by the 4-character
name of the corresponding volume. As a given volume
may describe several similar detectors in the physical setup,
some additional information is needed for associating
correctly the hits with the physical detectors.

When using \Rind{GSDET} the user has to enter the (shortest) list of volume
{\bf names} (the vector {\tt CHNMSV}), which permits unambiguous
identification of the path through the physical tree,
even in the presence of multiple copies.
This identification is obtained by specifying a list of volume
{\bf numbers} (the vector {\tt NUMBV}), in a one to one
correspondence with the list of volume names.
This list, after packing, will constitute the
identifier of the physical detector.

If \Rind{GSDETV} is used instead of
\Rind{GSDET} then the routine
\Rind{GGDETV} (called by \Rind{GGCLOS}) constructs the lists
{\tt CHNMSV} automatically and stores them in the structure {\tt JSET}.

\section{The user tools}
 
The data structure {\tt JSET} is built through
calls to the routine  \Rind{GSDET} or \Rind{GSDETV}
which assign detectors to
sets and define their parameters. After this, the
following routines can be called, for each detector, to complete the structure:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[\Rind{GSDETH}] provides the parameters required for the storage of the
hit elements in the data structure {\tt JHITS},
such as the packing and scaling conventions;
\item[\Rind{GSDETD}] provides the parameters required for the storage of
the digitisations in the structure {\tt JDIGI},
such as the packing conventions;
\item[\Rind{GSDETU}] adds the user parameters, which may consist,
for instance, of the intrinsic detector
characteristics needed for computing the digitisations.
\end{DLtt}

To permit storage of more than one type of hit for a given sensitive
detector, or to provide additional detector entries,
detector {\it aliases} can be defined through calls to the routine
\Rind{GSDETA}. They are entered in the {\tt JSET} structure as new detectors,
with the same geometrical characteristics as the original one.
The user has the possibility to call appropriate routines
\Rind{GSDETH}, \Rind{GSDETD} and \Rind{GSDETU} for this new detector.

During the tracking, for each step inside the
sensitive detectors, under control of the subroutine
\Rind{GUSTEP}, the hits can be stored in the data structure
{\tt JHITS} through the subroutine \Rind{GSAHIT} (or \Rind{GSCHIT}, more
appropriate for calorimetry).
For each hit the information consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item the reference to the track in the structure {\tt JKINE};
\item the packed identifier of the physical detector;
\item the packed data for the different elements of the hit.
\end{itemize}

When the tracking has been completed for the whole
event the digitisations can be
computed in the user subroutine \Rind{GUDIGI} which
may extract the hits with the subroutine \Rind{GFHITS} and
store the digitisations in the data structure {\tt JDIGI}, with
the subroutine \Rind{GSDIGI}.
For each digitisation the information should at least consist of:
\begin{itemize}
\item the reference to the track(s);
\item the packed identifier of the physical detector;
\item the packed data for the digitisation itself.
\end{itemize}

\section{Retrieval of geometrical information}
 
The packed identifier of a physical detector, stored as part of the hit
(or digitisation) information, is returned unpacked by the routine
\Rind{GFHITS} (or \Rind{GFDIGI}) which extracts the
information from the {\tt JHITS} or {\tt JDIGI} structures,
and may be used to retrieve the geometrical characteristics
of the given detector.

If the detectors have been defined by the routine \Rind{GSDETV}, the
geometrical information can be retrieved by the routines \Rind{GFPATH}
and \Rind{GLVOLU}. \Rind{GFPATH} prepares the lists {\tt CHNAM} and {\tt LNUM} 
required by \Rind{GLVOLU} ({\tt [GEOM001]}), from the information
preprocessed at initialisation time by the routine \Rind{GGDETV} and
stored in the structure {\tt JSET}

{\bf Note:} The vector {\tt CHNMSV} (length {\tt NV)} contains the list of
volume names which permit unambiguous identification of all copies of

Each element of the vector {\tt NBITSV} (length {\tt NV}) is the number
of bits used for packing the number of the corresponding volume, when building
the packed identifier of a given physical detector.

For more details see the example given in {\tt [HITS110]}.
The detector type {\tt IDTYP} is not used internally by {\tt GEANT}
and can be used to distinguish quickly between various
kinds of detectors, in the routine \Rind{GUSTEP} for example.

\Shubr{GSDETV}{(CHSET,CHDET,IDTYP,NWHI,NWDI,ISET*,IDET*)}
The arguments of this routine are the same than the previous one,
but {\tt NAMES, NBITSV} will be computed by \Rind{GGDETV} called by
\Rind{GGCLOS}) (see {\tt [HITS001]}).

\Shubr{GFDET}{(CHSET,CHDET,NV*,CHNMSV*,NBITSV*,IDTYP*,NWHI*,NWDI*,ISET*,IDET*)}
Returns the parameters for detector {\tt CHDET} of set {\tt CHSET}, the
arguments have the same meaning than for routine \Rind{GSDET}.

\Shubr{GPSETS}{(CHSET,CHDET)}
Prints {\tt SET} and {\tt DET}ector parameters.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHSET] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) set to be printed, if {\tt *} prints

\Makehead{Detector aliases}
Detector {\tt aliases} can be specified for any sensitive detector for which
the user either needs to store more than one type of hit
or wants to define additional detector entries.

\Shubr{GSDETA}{(CHSET,CHDET,CHALI,NWHI,NWDI,IALI*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHSET] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) set name;
\item[CHDET] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) name of the detector for which an alias
is being defined;
\item[CHALI] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) alias name;
\item[NWHI] ({\tt INTEGER}) initial number of words of {\tt HITS} banks;
\item[NWDI] ({\tt INTEGER}) initial number of words of {\tt DIGI} banks;
\item[IALI] ({\tt INTEGER}) position of alias in bank {\tt JS=LQ(JSET-ISET)}.
\end{DLtt}

Defines an alias {\tt CHALI} for detector {\tt CHDET} of set {\tt CHSET} and
enters it in the {\tt JSET} structure as an additional detector in the
corresponding set, at the position {\tt IALI}. The new detector will be
a copy at position {\tt IALI} of the original detector
{\tt CHDET}, with empty links to the \Rind{GSDETH}, \Rind{GSDETD} and
\Rind{GSDETU} parameter banks.
The user can therefore call these three routines again with the
arguments appropriate to the detector {\tt CHALI}.
Several aliases can be defined for
the same detector through calls to \Rind{GSDETA}.

\Makehead{{\tt DET}ector hit parameters}

\Shubr{GSDETH}{(CHSET,CHDET,NH,CHNAMH,NBITSH,ORIG,FACT)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHSET] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) set name;
\item[CHDET] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) detector name;
\item[NH] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the components of a hit;
\item[CHNAMH] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) array of {\tt NH} names for the hit components;
\item[NBITSH] ({\tt INTEGER}) array of {\tt NH}, 
{\tt NBITSH(I)} ({\tt I=1,...NH}) is the number of bits in which to pack
the {\tt I$^{th}$} component of the hit;
\item[ORIG] ({\tt REAL}) array of {\tt NH} offset applied before packing
the hits values;
\item[FACT] ({\tt REAL}) array of {\tt NH} scale factors applied before packing
the hits values;
\end{DLtt}

Defines hit parameters for detector {\tt CHDET} of set {\tt CHSET}.
The routine must be called at initialisation time once the
geometrical volumes have been defined to describe
the hit elements and the way to pack them in the data structure {\tt JHITS}.
The value of the hit before packing is transformed in the following way:

\begin{center}
\tt VAL(I) = (HIT(I)+ORIG(I)) $\times$ FACT(I)
\end{center}

\section*{Example}

Assume an electromagnetic calorimeter {\tt ECAL} divided into
40 {\tt PHI} sections called {\tt EPHI}. Each {\tt EPHI} division is in turn
divided along the $z$ axis in 60 sections called {\tt EZRI}. Each {\tt EZRI}
is finally divided into 4 lead glass blocks called {\tt BLOC}.
The geometrical information to describe one hit will then be:

\begin{itemize}
\item the {\tt EPHI} section number (between 1 and 40);
\item the {\tt EZRI} division number (between 1 and 60);
\item the {\tt BLOC} number (1 to 4).
\end{itemize}

The quantities which should be stored for each hit are:
 
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[X] $x$ position of the hit in the lead glass block ($-1000<x<1000$);
\item[Y] $y$ position of the hit in the lead glass block ($-1000<y<1000$);
\item[Z] $z$ position of the hit in the lead glass block ($-1000<z<1000$);
\item[E]energy of the particle;
\item[ELOS]the energy deposited;
\end{DLtt}

In this scheme a hit could look like:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{2cm}}l}
Element & Value \\ \hline
\tt EPHI  &  12  \\
\tt EZRI  &  41  \\
\tt BLOC  &   3  \\
\tt X  &     7.89 cm  \\
\tt Y  &     -345.6 cm  \\
\tt Z  &     1234.8 cm  \\
\tt E  &     12 Gev  \\
\tt ELOS  &   11.85 Gev  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The code to define the {\tt SET/DET/HIT} information could be:
\begin{verbatim}
      CHARACTER*4 CHNMSV(3),CHNAMH(5)
      DIMENSION   NBITSV(3),NBITSH(5)
      DIMENSION   ORIG(5),FACT(5)

      DATA ORIG   / 1000., 1000., 1000.,    0.,    0./
      DATA FACT   /   10.,   10.,   10.,  100.,  100./
*---
      CALL GSDET ('ECAL','BLOC',3,CHNMSV,NBITSV,2,100,100,ISET,IDET)
      CALL GSDETH('ECAL','BLOC',5,CHNAMH,NBITSH,ORIG,FACT)
\end{verbatim}

\Shubr{GFDETH}{(CHSET,CHDET,NH*,CHNAMH*,NBITSH*,ORIG*,FACT*)}
Returns the hit parameters for detector {\tt CHDET} of set {\tt CHSET}.
All arguments are as explained above.

({\tt I=1,...,ND})
is the number of bits into which to pack the {\tt I$^{th}$} element of the

\end{DLtt}
Defines digitisation parameters for detector {\tt CHDET} of set {\tt CHSET}.
The routine must be called at initialisation, after the
geometrical volumes have been defined, to describe
the digitisation elements and the way to pack them in the data structure
{\tt JDIGI}.

\section*{Example}
Following on from the example in {\tt [HITS110]}, we want to add the 
digitisation information to detector {\tt EPHI} of set {\tt ECAL}. The
information which should be stored for each digitisation is 
the ADC pulse height in the lead glass block, so that a digitisation
in this scheme could look like:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{2cm}}l}
Element & Value \\ \hline
\tt EPHI  &  12  \\
\tt EZRI  &  41  \\
\tt BLOC  &   3  \\
\tt ADC  &   789 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The code to define the digitisation information could be:
\begin{verbatim}
     CHARACTER*4 CHNMSD
     DATA CHNMSD/'ADC '/ 
     DATA NBITSD/16/    
 
     CALL GSDETD('ECAL','BLOC',1,CHNMSD,NBITSD)
\end{verbatim}

\Shubr{GFDETD}{(CHSET,CHDET,ND*,CHNMSD*,NBITSD*)}
Returns the digitisation parameters for detector {\tt CHDET} of set {\tt
CHSET}.  All arguments as explained in \Rind{GSDETD}.

\Shubr{GSAHIT}{(ISET,IDET,ITRA,NUMBV,HITS,IHIT*)}

\item[ISET]  ({\tt INTEGER}) set number (see below);

\item[ITRA]  ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the track producing this hit
\item[NUMBV] ({\tt INTEGER}) array of volume numbers corresponding

\item[HITS] ({\tt REAL}) array of values for current hit elements;
\item[IHIT] ({\tt INTEGER}) current hit number, if 0 the
hit has not been stored.
\end{DLtt}

Stores element values for current hit into the data structure {\tt
JHITS}. The values {\tt ISET}, {\tt IDET} and {\tt NUMBV} can be found
in the corresponding variables of common \FCind{/GCSETS/}. These values
are set by the routine \Rind{GFINDS} every time that a particle is in
a defined detector.

\Shubr{GSCHIT}{(ISET,IDET,ITRA,NUMBV,HITS,NHSUM,IHIT*)}
Same action as \Rind{GSAHIT}, but in case the detector identified by
{\tt ISET}, {\tt IDET} and
{\tt NUMBV} contains already a hit for the same track, the routine will
make a cummulative sum for the latest {\tt NHSUM} elements of {\tt JHITS}.
The other previous elements of {\tt JHITS} are replaced.
That facility is particularly interesting in the case of
hits generated into a calorimeter. No packing (i.e. 32 bits per
hit element) should be requested for the
last {\tt NHSUM} hits in \Rind{GSDETH} and for these hits {\tt ORIG} should
be set to 0.

\Shubr{GPHITS}{(CHSET,CHDET)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}

\end{DLtt}
Prints {\tt JHITS} banks for detector {\tt CHDET} of set {\tt CHSET}.

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHSET] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) set name;
\item[CHDET] ({\tt CHARACTER*4}) detector name;
\item[NVDIM] ({\tt INTEGER}) 1$^{st}$ dimension of arrays {\tt NUMBV} and
{\tt NUMVS}: 1$\leq${\tt NVDIM}$\leq${\tt NV} argument of \Rind{GSDET};
\item[NHDIM] ({\tt INTEGER}) 1$^{st}$ dimension of array {\tt HITS}:
1$\leq${\tt NHDIM}$\leq${\tt NH} argument of \Rind{GSDETH};
\item[NHMAX] ({\tt INTEGER}) maximum number of hits to be returned, this 
should be not larger than the second dimension of array {\tt NUMBV} and
{\tt HITS};
\item[ITRS] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the selected track,
if {\tt ITRS=0}, all tracks are taken;
\item[NUMVS] ({\tt INTEGER}) is a 1-dimension array of {\tt NVDIM}
elements that contains
the list of volume numbers which identify the selected detector,
0 is interpreted as 'all valid numbers';
\item[ITRA] ({\tt INTEGER}) is a 1-dim array of dimension {\tt NHMAX}
that contains on output
for each hit the number of the track which has produced it;
\item[NUMBV] ({\tt INTEGER}) 2-dim array ({\tt NVDIM,NHMAX})
that containis on output for each hit the
list of volume numbers which identify the detector, all values set to 
0 means that no more volumes are stored;
\item[HITS] ({\tt REAL}) 2-dim array ({\tt NHDIM,NHMAX}) that containis 
{\tt NHITS} hits;
\item[NHITS] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of hits returned, in case the total
number of hits is greater than {\tt NHMAX, NHITS} is set to
{\tt NHMAX+1} and {\tt NHMAX} hits are returned.
\end{DLtt}

This rotine returns the hits produced by track {\tt ITRS} (or by any track) in
the detector {\tt CHDET} identified by the list {\tt NUMVS}
belonging to set {\tt CHSET}.

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMMMM}
\item[HITS(1,I)] is element 1 of hit number {\tt I};
\item[NUMBV(1,I)] is volume number 1 of hit number {\tt I};
\item[ITRA(I)] is the track number corresponding to hit number {\tt I};
\end{DLtt}

The arrays {\tt NUMVS, NUMBV, HITS}
and {\tt ITRA} must be dimensioned to:
\begin{verbatim}
    NUMVS(NVDIM)
    NUMBV(NVDIM,NHMAX)
    HITS(NHDIM,NHMAX)
    ITRA(NHMAX)
\end{verbatim}

\item[IDET] ({\tt INTEGER}) detector number;
\item[NUMBV] ({\tt INTEGER}) array of numbers which identify uniquely
detector number {\tt IDET};
\item[NLEV] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of elements filled of arrays
{\tt LNAM} and {\tt LNUM};
\item[LNAM] ({\tt INTEGER}) array of {\tt NLEV} volume names stored in 
ASCII code in integers;
\item[LNUM] ({\tt INTEGER}) array of {\tt NLEV} copy numbers.
\end{DLtt}

This routine returns the list of volume names and numbers
which identify the complete ancestry in the {\tt JVOLUM} data structure of the
volume corresponding to the detector number {\tt IDET} in set
number {\tt ISET} and which is identified by the volume numbers {\tt NUMBV}
(see \Rind{GFHITS}).
 
\Rind{GFPATH} assumes that the detectors have been declared via 
\Rind{GSDETV} and not \Rind{GSDET}. The main use of \Rind{GFPATH} is to
prepare the lists {\tt LNAM} and {\tt LNUM} required  by the routine
\Rind{GLVOLU} to fill the common \FCind{/GCVOLU/}. Once \FCind{/GCVOLU/}
is properly filled, it is possible to use the {\tt GEANT} routines to

\end{verbatim}
     \caption{Coordinate system along the wire}
     \label{fg:hits510-1}
\end{figure}

Knowing the position $Z$ of the deposit of charge we can calculate
\[
\mbox{\tt ICD} = L \frac{Z-Z_l}{Z_u -Z_l} 
\]
where $L=1000$ in the
program. This is the information stored into {\tt IOUT(3)}.

\Shubr{GCDERR}{(ICD*,ERP,ERS)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[ICD] ({\tt INTEGER}) digitised current division information 
($\leq\mbox{\tt ICD}\leq1000$), overwritten on output with the
modified value taking into account the errors;
\item[ERP] ({\tt REAL}) variance of Gaussian pedestal errors 
on the measured
pulse heights relative to the sum of the pulse heights;
\item[ERS] ({\tt REAL}) variance of Gaussian slope 
errors on the measured
pulse heights relative to the each pulse heights.
\end{DLtt}
Routine to calculate the error on the current division
information as obtained by \Rind{GCDRIF}.
Here we assume that {\tt ICD} has been determined by measuring the pulse heights 
$I_1, I_2$ at the two ends of the wire with the formula:
\[
\mbox{\tt ICD} = L \; \frac{I_2}{I_+} 
\mbox{\hspace{1cm}with\hspace{1cm}}  I_+ = I_1+I_2 
\]
Its error is determined by:
\[
\delta \mbox{\tt ICD} = - \frac{\mbox{\tt ICD}}{I_+} \delta I_1 + 
\frac{L-\mbox{\tt ICD}}{I_+}  \delta I_2
\mbox{\hspace{5mm}and\hspace{5mm}}
\delta I_1 = \delta_1 + \epsilon_1 \; I_1  \mbox{\hspace{3mm};\hspace{3mm}}
\delta I_2 = \delta_2 + \epsilon_2 \; I_2 
\]
 
 
$\delta_1$ and $\delta_2 $ are of dimension {\tt [I]} and represent the 
{\it pedestal} errors. $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ are the {\it slope} errors.
Errors are independent (no correlations), with a Gaussian distribution with 
average 0 and {\tt ERP} as relative variance for pedestals $\delta_i/I_+$ 
and {\tt ERS} as variance for slopes $\epsilon_i$.  This gives the final result
 
\[
\delta \mbox{\tt ICD}   = \underbrace{-\frac{\delta_1}{I_+}\mbox{\tt ICD} +
                 \frac{\delta_2}{I_+}(L-\mbox{\tt ICD})}_{\mbox{\it pedestals}}
               +
 \underbrace{(\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1)
\frac{\mbox{\tt ICD}(L-\mbox{\tt ICD})}{L}}_{\mbox{\it slope}}
\]

\Rind{GCDERR} sets the {\tt ICD} obtained from \Rind{GCDRIF} to
$\mbox{\tt ICD}=\mbox{\tt ICD}+\delta \mbox{\tt ICD}$ with 
$ 0 \leq \mbox{\tt ICD}\leq L$.

\Sfunc{GUDTIM}{VALUE = GUDTIM(DETREP,HITREP,IW1,DIS)}
The arguments have the same meaning than for \Rind{GCDRIF} apart from:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[IW1] ({\tt INTEGER}) wire number which will generate a signal;
\item[DIS] ({\tt REAL}) distance from the track to the wire;
\end{DLtt}
This function has to be written by the user to return the drift time
in nanoseconds.

\Makehead{The I/O  routines}
The I/O routines allow one to read, write or print the
{\tt GEANT} data structures. All {\tt GEANT} I/O is handled though
the {\tt ZEBRA} system, which provides the following facilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item native and machine independent I/O to and from disk and tape
devices;
\item sequential and direct access I/O (from disk);
\end{itemize}

This allows, for example, to generate events on one machine, dump
the data structures to a mass storage device, and then read them
back for further processing on a different machine.

This section describes the various routines for I/O in {\tt GEANT}.
For a complete reference on the {\tt ZEBRA} I/O system the user
is referred to the {\tt ZEBRA} documentation~\cite{bib-ZEBRAFZ,bib-ZEBRA}.

mandatory routines for all open {\tt ZEBRA} files before the end of the
program. Failure to call this routine may cause files to be incompletely
written to the storage media.

\Makehead{{\tt ZEBRA} direct access files handling}

I/O with direct access files is the most efficient way to use direct
access devices. All the routines described in this section and in
({\tt [IOPA500]}) are based on the {\tt ZEBRA-RZ} package and the
user is referred to the related documentation~\cite{bib-ZEBRA}
for an understanding of the basic principles.

\Shubr{GRFILE}{(LUN,CHFILE,CHOPT)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[LUN] ({\tt INTEGER}) logical unit number;
\item[CHFILE] ({\tt CHARACTER*(*)}) file name;
\item[CHOPT] ({\tt CHARACTER*(*)}) any valid option for \Rind{RZOPEN},
\Rind{RZMAKE} and \Rind{RZFILE} and in particular:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[N] create a new file;
\item[U] open an existing file for update;
\item[Q] the initial allocation (default 1000 records)
is in {\tt IQUEST(10)};
\item[I] read all initialisation data structures (see description of 
\Rind{GRIN}/\Rind{GROUT}) from file to memory;
\item[O] write all initialisation data structures from memory to file;
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}

This routine opens a file for direct access I/O of {\tt ZEBRA} data
structures. By default the file is opened in exchange mode and the option
{\tt W} is added, which creates an {\tt RZ} top level directory with the
name {\tt //LUNnn} where {\tt nn} is the logical unit number.

The default allocation of an {\tt RZ} directory is enough for 1000 records,
which allows for a 4Mb file with the standard record length of 1024 words. 
If a larger file is needed, the size of the directory should be changed 
when creating the file. This can be done by assigning to the variable
{\tt IQUEST(10)} in the common \FCind{/QUEST/} the requested number of records,
and calling \Rind{GRFILE} with the option {\tt Q} as shown in the following
example:
\begin{verbatim}
      COMMON / QUEST / IQUEST(100)
      .
      .
      .
      IQUEST(10) = 5000
      CALL GRFILE(1,'mygeom.geom','Q')
\end{verbatim}

\Shubr{GRMDIR}{(CHDIR,CHOPT)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHDIR] ({\tt CHARACTER*(*)}) subdirectory name to create;
\item[CHOPT] option string:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[' '] create a subdirectory;
\item[S] create a subdirectory and set the current directory to it;
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}
This routine creates an {\tt RZ} subdirectory.

\Shubr{GREND}{(LUN)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[LUN] ({\tt INTEGER}) logical unit number (see \Rind{RZEND} in
the {\tt ZEBRA} manual~\cite{bib-ZEBRA});
\end{DLtt}
 
Routine to close an {\tt RZ} file. It is very important to call this
routine for all {\tt RZ} files open in write mode. Failure to do may
result in the files being incompletely written or corrupted.

\Makehead{Data structure I/O with direct access files}

\Shubr{GRIN}{(CHOBJ,IDVERS*,CHOPT)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[CHOBJ] ({\tt CHARACTER*(4)}) name of the data structure to
read in, see {\tt [IOPA300]} for more information on this;
\item[IDVERS] ({\tt INTEGER}) version of the data structure to be read in,
if 0 it will read any version, on output it contains the version of the
data structure read in;
\item[CHOPT] ({\tt CHARACTER*(*)})  option:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMM}
\item[I] perform read only if
{\tt CHOBJ} is an initialisation data structure;
\item[K] perform read only if {\tt CHOBJ} is {\tt KINE} or {\tt TRIG};
\item[T] perform read only if {\tt CHOBJ} is 
{\tt DIGI}, {\tt HEAD}, {\tt HITS}, {\tt KINE},
{\tt VERT} or {\tt JXYZ};
\item[Q] quiet option, no message is printed;
\end{DLtt}
\end{DLtt}

This routine reads {\tt GEANT} data structures from the current working
directory of an {\tt RZ} file (see the {\tt ZEBRA} documentation for
a clarification of this concept). Example:
\begin{verbatim}

      CALL GRFILE(1,'Geometry.dat',' ')
      CALL GRIN ('VOLU',1,' ') 
      CALL GRIN ('MATE',1,' ')
      CALL GRIN ('TMED',1,' ')
      CALL GRIN ('ROTM',1,' ')
      CALL GRIN ('PART',1,' ')
      CALL GRIN ('SCAN',1,' ')
      CALL GRIN ('SETS',1,' ')
\end{verbatim}

The same result can be achieved by:
\begin{verbatim}

      CALL GRFILE(1,'Geometry.dat','I')
\end{verbatim}

\Shubr{GROUT}{(CHOBJ,IDVERS,CHOPT)}
The meaning of the arguments is the same than in the previous routine
\Rind{GRIN}, but for writing instead than for reading.

This routine writes {\tt GEANT} data structures into the current working
directory of an {\tt RZ} file (see the {\tt ZEBRA} documentation for
a clarification of this concept).
Note that if the cross-sections and energy loss tables
are available in the data structure {\tt JMATE}, then they are
saved on the data base.
The data structures saved by this routine can be retrieved
with the routine \Rind{GRIN}.
Before calling this routine a {\\tt RZ} data base must have been
created using \Rind{GRFILE}.
The data base must be closed with \Rind{RZEND}. Example:
\begin{verbatim}

      CALL GRFILE(1,'Geometry.dat','N')
      CALL GROUT ('VOLU',1,' ') 
      CALL GROUT ('MATE',1,' ')
      CALL GROUT ('TMED',1,' ')
      CALL GROUT ('ROTM',1,' ')
      CALL GROUT ('PART',1,' ')
      CALL GROUT ('SCAN',1,' ')
      CALL GROUT ('SETS',1,' ')
\end{verbatim}

The same result can be achieved by:
\begin{verbatim}

      CALL GRFILE(1,'Geometry.dat','NO')
\end{verbatim}

The interactive version of {tt GEANT} provides facilities
to interactively update, create and display objects.


The routines \Rind{GRGET} and \Rind{GRSAVE} are obsolete and should not 
be used.

\Makehead{Storing and retrieving vertex and track parameters}

\Shubr{GSVERT}{(VERT,NTBEAM,NTTARG,UBUF,NUBUF,NVTX*)}
 
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[VERT] ({\tt REAL}) array of 3 containing the position of 
the vertex in the {\tt MRS};
\item[NTBEAM] ({\tt INTEGER}) beam track number origin of the vertex
(0 if none exists);
\item[NTTARG] ({\tt INTEGER}) target track number origin of the vertex
(0 if none exists);
\item[UBUF] ({\tt REAL}) user array of {\tt NUBUF} user words
to be stored in the data structure together with the vertex;
\item[NWBUF] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of user words;
\item[NVTX] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the vertex stored (0 in case of error).
\end{DLtt}

This routine stores the parameters of a vertex to which tracks should be
attached via calls to \Rind{GSKINE}. Vertices are stored in the {\tt JVERTX}
data structure (see {\tt [KINE199]}) and they are preserved for the whole
duration of the event.

{\tt GEANT} tracks one vertex at a time: all the particles of one
vertex, and all the secondaries generated thereof must be transported
before the particles of the next vertex are considered.

This routine should be called only from \Rind{GUKINE} when the initial
kinematics of the event is defined. During tracking it is possible to add
vertices to the {\tt JVERTX} data structure, but this should be done via
the \Rind{GSKING} routine and the appropriate variables in the \FCind{/GCKING/}
common block. Please see {\tt [TRAK300]} for more information.

\Shubr{GSVERU}{(NVTX,NUBUF,UBUF,IADR*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[NVTX] ({\tt INTEGER}) vertex number;
\item[NUBUF] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of user words;
\item[UBUF] ({\tt REAL}) array of user words;
\item[IADR] ({\tt INTEGER}) position where information is stored in the
user bank of the vertex.
\end{DLtt}

This routine stores the first {\tt NUBUF} words of array {\tt BUF} in the
user bank attached to vertex {\tt NVTX}, starting at location {\tt IADR+1}.
On exit {\tt IADR} is set to {\tt IADR+NUBUF}, allowing subsequent filling. 
This allows effectively 
to {\it add} information to an existing vertex, whether or not it has already
an user buffer. This is the only way to add user information to a vertex
which has been created at tracking time by the routine \Rind{GSKING} via
an appropriate setting of parameters in the common \FCind{/GCKING/}.

\Shubr{GFVERT}{(VERT*,NTBEAM*,NTTARG*,UBUF*,NUBUF*)}
Retrieves vertex parameters. The parameters have the same meaning
than the ones of \Rind{GSVERT}.

\Shubr{GPVERT}{(IVTX)}
 
Prints vertex parameters.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[IVTX] ({\tt INTEGER}) vertex number to be printed, all vertices if IVTX=0;
\end{DLtt}

\Shubr{GSKINE}{(PLAB,IPART,NV,UBUF,NUBUF,NT*)}
 
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[PLAB] ({\tt REAL}) array of 3 containing the components of
the momentum of the particle in GeV c$^{-1}$;
\item[IPART] ({\tt INTEGER}) particle code (see {\tt [CONS300]});
\item[NV] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the vertex origin of track;
\item[UBUF] ({\tt REAL}) array of {\tt NUBUF} user words
to be stored with the track;
\item[NUBUF] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of user words;
\item[NT] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the stored track (0 in case of error).
\end{DLtt}

This routine stores the parameters of a track in the {\tt JKINE}
data structure (see {\tt [KINE199]}). This data structure survives for
the whole event, and it is wiped out by \Rind{GTRIGI} at the beginning 
of each new event.  There are two reasons to store tracks
in the {\tt JKINE} data structure:
\begin{itemize}
\item at the beginning of an event, from within \Rind{GUKINE}, to define
the initial kinematics of the event, i.e. the particles which {\tt GEANT}
will transport. This must be done through \Rind{GSKINE}
after that the vertices from which the particles originate have been defined
through \Rind{GSVERT};
\item during tracking, to preserve the kinematic information of a 
particular track till the end of the current event. In this case the user should
not call \Rind{GSKINE} directly, but rather set the appropriate flags in the
\FCind{/GCKING/} common block and call \Rind{GSKING}. This is explained in 
detail in {\tt [TRAK300]}.
\end{itemize}

\Shubr{GSKINU}{(NT,NUBUF,UBUF,IADR*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[NT] ({\tt INTEGER}) track number;
\item[NUBUF] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of user words;
\item[UBUF] ({\tt REAL}) array of user words;
\item[IADR] ({\tt INTEGER}) position where information is stored in the
user bank of the track.
\end{DLtt}

This routine stores the first {\tt NUBUF} words of array {\tt BUF} in the
user bank attached to track {\tt NT}, starting at location {\tt IADR+1}.
On exit {\tt IADR} is set to {\tt IADR+NUBUF}, allowing subsequent filling. 
This allows effectively 
to {\it add} information to an existing track, whether or not it has already
an user buffer. This is the only way to add user information to a track
which has been created at tracking time by the routine \Rind{GSKING} via
an appropriate setting of parameters in the common \FCind{/GCKING/}.

\Shubr{GFKINE}{(ITRA,VERT*,PVERT*,IPART*,NVERT*,UBUF*,NUBUF*)}
Retrieves long-life track parameters. The parameters have the same meaning
than the ones of \Rind{GSKINE}.

\Shubr{GPKINE}{(ITRA)}
Prints initial track parameters.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[ITRA] ({\tt INTEGER}) track to be printed, all tracks if {\tt IVTX}=0;
\end{DLtt}

\Makehead{Interface to the Lund Monte Carlo}

{\tt GEANT} contains a simple interface to the {\tt JETSET} Monte
Carlo generator~\cite{bib-JETS}. This interface is composed by an
initialisation routine and an event generation routine.

\Shubr{GLUNDI}{}
This is the initialisation routine which should be called before the
call to \Rind{GFFGO}, as it defines the data record {\tt LUND}. This routine
performs the following actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item sets {\tt ECLUND}$=\sqrt{s}=92.25$ GeV;
\item sets {\tt IFLUND}$=0$;
\item activates initial state radiative effects {\tt MSTJ(107)= 1};
\item declares some particles ($K^0_s$, $\Sigma^{\pm}$, $\Xi^{\pm}$,
$\Lambda^0$, $\Omega^-$) to be stable in {\tt JETSET} so that {\tt GEANT}
can handle their tracking and decays:
\begin{verbatim}
         MDCY(LUCOMP(310) ,1)=0
         MDCY(LUCOMP(3222),1)=0
         MDCY(LUCOMP(3112),1)=0
         MDCY(LUCOMP(3322),1)=0
         MDCY(LUCOMP(3312),1)=0
         MDCY(LUCOMP(3122),1)=0
         MDCY(LUCOMP(3334),1)=0
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

Variables {\tt ECLUND}, total energy in the CMS, and {\tt IFLUND}, quark
flavours produced, are used as arguments for \Rind{LUEEVT} called by
\Rind{GLUND} and they can be changed via the {\tt LUND} data record
(see {\tt [BASE040]}).

\Shubr{GLUND}{}
Generate a \Pem\Pep collision via the {\tt JETSET} MonteCarlo and stores
the resulting final state particles for transport by {\tt GEANT}. All
particles are attached to a vertex in (0.,0.,0.). The {\tt K} and {\tt P}
arrays containing the full {\tt JETSET} event are copied in the user
buffer of the generated vertex, with the {\tt K} variables converted into
{\tt REAL} numbers. The content of the user buffer is the following:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\begin{array}{r@{}lc}
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 1)~} & 527.0 \\
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 2)~} & \mbox{{\tt N} number of particles}
\end{array} \\
\left .
\begin{array}{r@{}l@{\hspace{1cm}}l}
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 3)} & \mbox{\tt K(1,1)} \\
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 4)} & \mbox{\tt K(1,2)} \\
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 5)} & \mbox{\tt K(1,3)} \\
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 6)} & \mbox{\tt K(1,4)} \\
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 7)} & \mbox{\tt K(1,5)} \\
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 8)} & \mbox{\tt P(1,1)} \\
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 9)} & \mbox{\tt P(1,2)} \\
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 10)} & \mbox{\tt P(1,3)} \\
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 11)} & \mbox{\tt P(1,4)} \\
\mbox{\tt UBUF(} & \mbox{\tt 12)} & \mbox{\tt P(1,5)}
\end{array} \right \} & \mbox{{\tt N} times}
\end{array}

\Makehead{Introduction to the section PHYS}
\section{Summary of the physics processes}
 
The computer simulation of particles traversing an
experimental setup has to take into account the interactions of those
particles with the material of the detector.
{\tt GEANT} is able to simulate the dominant processes which can occur in the
energy range {\bf from 10 keV to 10 TeV} for electromagnetic interactions.
As far as hadronic interactions are concerned, the range of validity
is the one of the hadronic packages used, which usually does not extend
below a few tens of MeV. For more information the user is invited to 
consult the relevant 
documentation~\cite{bib-GHEI,bib-FLUK,bib-FLU1,bib-FLU2,bib-FLU3,bib-FLU4}.
 
Simulating a given process means:
\begin{UL}
\item
Evaluating the probability of occurrence of the process, by sampling the
{\bf total cross-section} of the process.
\item
Generating the final state after interaction, by sampling the
{\bf differential cross-section} of the process.
\item
In case of (quasi-)continuous processes, e.g. CSDA
(Continuous Slowing Down Approximation), energy losses or multiple 
scattering, computing the mean values of some characteristic quantities.
\end{UL}
In Table~\ref{phys001-1} below we summarise all the processes currently 
implemented in {\tt GEANT}, with a reference to the corresponding sections.

\subsection{ Simulated Processes }
 
\subsubsection{Hadronic Interactions}

To simulate the interactions of hadrons with the nuclei of the matter 
traversed, two alternatives are provided:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The generator of the \Rind{FLUKA}~\cite{bib-FLUK,bib-FLU1}
hadron shower MonteCarlo and the
interface routines to {\tt GEANT}. See {\tt [PHYS520]} for more information.
\item The generator of the \Rind{GHEISHA}~\cite{bib-GHEI}
hadron shower MonteCarlo and the
interface routines to {\tt GEANT}. See {\tt [PHYS510]} for more information.
\end{enumerate}
 
The code both of the \Rind{GHEISHA} and of the \Rind{FLUKA} generators is
contained in the {\tt GEANT} library. Users should be aware that the
routines of these packages do not follow the {\tt GEANT} naming conventions
and therefore they can clash with the names of user procedures.
 
\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Processes}
By means of systematic fits to the existing
data, the cross-sections of the electromagnetic processes are well reproduced
(within a few percent) from 10 keV up to 100 GeV, both for light (low Z) and
for heavy materials.
 
This feature, together with the use of the interface with one of the
hadronic shower generators available,
makes {\tt GEANT} useful also for shower simulation in gases.
 
\subsubsection{Muonic interactions}
Muonic interactions are simulated up to 10 TeV, making
{\tt GEANT} useful for cosmic rays studies.
 
\subsubsection{Ionisation by charged particles}
The following alternatives are provided to simulate this process:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sampling from the appropriate distribution around the mean value 
of the energy loss ({\tt [PHYS332]}).
\item
Explicit generation of $\delta$-rays (see {\tt [PHYS330/331/430]}) and 
restricted fluctuations below the energy threshold for the production
of $\delta$-rays.
\item
Sampling the contribution of single collisions from statistical 
distributions. This can be used as an alternative to the first one when
simulating energy losses 
in very thin layers (small value of g  cm$^{-2}$) (see {\tt [PHYS334]}).
\end{itemize}
Full Landau fluctuations and generation of $\delta$-rays cannot be used
together in order
to avoid double counting of the fluctuations. An automatic protection
has been introduced in {\tt GEANT} to this effect.
See {\tt [PHYS333/332]} and {\tt [BASE040]} for further information.
 
\subsubsection{Multiple Scattering}
Two methods are provided:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Moli\`ere distribution or plural scattering ({\tt [PHYS325], [PHYS328]}).
\item Gaussian approximation ({\tt [PHYS320]}).
\end{enumerate}
 
\subsubsection{The JMATE data structure}
In order to save time during the transport of the particles, relevant 
energy-dependent quantities are tabulated at the beginning of the run, for 
all materials, as functions of the kinetic energy of the particle.
In particular, the inverse of the total cross-sections 
of all processes involving photons, electrons and muons and the $dE/dx$ and 
range tables for electrons, muons and protons are calculated.
The actual value of, say, the interaction length for a given process (i.e. the
inverse of the macroscopic cross section) is then obtained via a linear
interpolation in the tables. The data structure which contains all this
information in memory is supported by the link {\tt JMATE} in the 
\FCind{/GCLINK/} common block.
See {\tt [PHYS100]} and {\tt [CONS199]} for a more information on these tables.
 
\subsubsection{Probability of Interaction}
The total cross-section of each process is used at tracking time to evaluate 
the probability of occurrence of the process. See {\tt [PHYS010]} for an 
explanation of the method used.
 
{\bf Note}: The section {\tt PHYS} is closely related to the section {\tt CONS}.
Users wishing to have a complete overview of the physics processes
included in {\tt GEANT} should read both sections.

\subsection{ Control of the physical processes}
 
For most of the individual processes the default option (indicated
below) can be changed via data records {\tt [BASE030/040]}.
The processes are controlled via a control variable which is in the
common \FCind{/GCKING/}. 
If not otherwise noted, 
the meaning of the control variable is the following:
\begin{DLtt}{MMM}
\item[= 0] The process is completely ignored. 
\item[= 1] The process is considered and possible secondary particles generating
from the interaction are put into the \FCind{/GCKING/} common. If the
interacting particle disappears in the interaction, then it is stopped
with {\tt ISTOP=1} (common \FCind{/GCTRAK/})
\item[= 2] The process is considered. If secondary particles result from the
interaction, they are not generated and their energy is simply added in the
variable {\tt DESTEP} (common \FCind{/GCTRAK/}. If the interacting particle
disappears in the interaction, the variable {\tt ISTOP} is set
to $2$.

\section {Principle}
The simulation of the processes which accompany the propagation of a
particle through the material of the detector
(e.g. bremsstrahlung,
$\delta$-rays production, Compton scattering and so on)
is performed by {\tt GEANT} in the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fetch a new particle to be tracked (often called {\it track} or
{\it history}) from the stack supported by the link {\tt JSTAK} (see 
{\tt [TRAK399]}). This is done once at the beginning of each new track. 
The number of {\it interaction lengths} that the particle is going to 
travel, before undergoing each one of the possible discrete processes, 
is sampled at this point. These operations are done in the routine 
\Rind{GLTRAC}.
\item Evaluate the distance to the interaction point.
This is done by the individual tracking routines
(\Rind{GTGAMA}, \Rind{GTNEUT}, \Rind{GTHADR}, \Rind{GTNINO},
\Rind{GTMUON}, \Rind{GTHION} and \Rind{GTCKOV}) which control the 
tracking of particular particles.
The number of interaction lengths remaining to travel
before each of the
possible processes (often called {\it tracking mechanisms} or simply
{\it mechanisms}) is multiplied
by the inverse of the macroscopic cross-section
for that process in the current material (i.e. the interaction
length). This gives the distances that the particle has to travel before
each of the processes occurs in the current medium. 
The minimum among these numbers is the
{\it step} over which the particle will be transported. In addition to
the physics mechanisms, four
{\it pseudo-interactions} are taken into account in the calculation of
the step:
\begin{enumerate}
\item boundary crossing. The crossing of a volume boundary is treated
like a discrete process. A particle never crosses a boundary
during a step but rather stops there ({\tt NEXT} mechanism);
\item maximum step limit. For each tracking medium a value for the
maximum step can be specified by the user. Process {\tt SMAX};
\item maximum fraction of continuum energy loss, maximum angular
deviation in magnetic
field or maximum step for which the Moli\`ere formula, to simulate
multiple scattering is valid. These are continuous processes,
which introduce a limitation on the tracking step expressed by a
single variable (see section {\tt [PHYS325]} on \Rind{GMULOF}).
\item energy and time cut. Charged particles in matter are stopped when their
energy falls below their energy threshold or when their time of flight
exceeds the time cut;
\end{enumerate}
More information is given in the
individual sections explaining the implementation of the physical
processes.
\item Transport the particle either along a
straight line (if no magnetic field or for a
neutral particle) or along a helicoidal
path (for charged particles in magnetic field).
\item Update the energy of the particle if continuous energy loss was
in effect (charged particles in matter).
\item If a physical discrete process has been selected,
generate the final state of the interaction.
\item  If
the incident particle {\it survives} the interaction
(Compton, $\delta$-rays production, bremsstrahlung, direct pair
production by $\mu$ and $\mu$-nucleus interaction, hadronic elastic
scattering), sample
again the number of interaction lengths to travel before the next
event of the same kind. This is generally done by specialised routines:
\Rind{GMUNU}, \Rind{GCOMP}, \Rind{GBREM}, etc.
\item Update the number of interaction
lengths for all the processes and go back to $(2)$ till the particle
either leaves the detector or falls below its energy threshold or
beyond its time cut or disappears in an interaction.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Distance evaluation}
\subsection{The interaction length}
Let $\sigma(E,Z,A)$ be the total microscopic
cross section for a given interaction.
The mean free path, $\lambda$, for a particle to interact is given by:
\begin{equation}
\lambda  = \frac{1}{\Sigma}
\end{equation}
 
where $\Sigma$ is the macroscopic cross-section in $cm^{-1}$. This quantity
is given for an element by:
 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma  = \frac{N_{Av} \rho\sigma (E,Z,A)}{A}
\end{equation}
 
and for a compound or a mixture by:
 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma  = \frac{N_{Av}\rho \sum_i
          n_i\sigma(E,Z_i,A_i)}{\sum_i
          n_iA_i}
        = N_{Av} \rho \sum_i \frac{p_i}{A_i}\: \sigma(E,Z_i,A_i)
\end{equation}
 
\begin{tabular}[t]{ll}
$N_{Av}$         & Avogadro's number ($6.02486 \times 10^{23}$) \\
$Z$         & atomic number  \\
$A$         & atomic weight  \\
$\rho$    & density \\
$\sigma$  & total cross-section for the reaction \\
$n_i$   & \parbox[t]{14cm}{proportion by number of the $i^{th}$  
element in the material} \\
$p_i$ & \parbox[t]{14cm}{$=n_{i} A_{i}/ \sum_j n_jA_j$, proportion by 
weight of the $i^{th}$ element in the material}
\end{tabular}
 
For electromagnetic processes which depend linearly on the atomic number 
$Z$ we can write:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Sigma(E)  & =  & N_{Av} \rho \sum_i \frac{p_i}{A_i}\: \sigma(E,Z_i) =
N_{Av} \rho \sum_i \frac{p_i}{A_i}\: Z_i f(E) \\
& = & N_{Av} \rho f(E) \sum_i \frac{p_i}{A_i}\: Z_i = N_{Av} \rho f(E) Z_{eff} \\
Z_{eff} & = & \sum_i \frac{p_i}{A_i}\: Z_i 
\end{eqnarray*}

the value above of $Z_{eff}$ is calculated by \Rind{GPROBI}.
This mean free path is tabulated at initialisation time as a function
of the kinetic energy of the particle, or, for hadronic interactions,
it is calculated at tracking time.

Cross sections are tabulated in the energy range defined as: 
$\mbox{\tt ELOW(1)} \leq E \leq \mbox{\tt ELOW(NEK1)}$
in {\tt NEK1} bins. These values can be redefined by the data record
{\tt RANGE}. Default values are $\mbox{\tt ELOW(1)} = 10 keV$,
$\mbox{\tt ELOW(NEK1)} = 10 TeV$ and $\mbox{\tt NEKBIN} = 
\mbox{\tt NEK1}-1 = 90$. {\tt NEKBIN} cannot be bigger than 199.
The array {\tt ELOW} is in the common \FCind{/GCMULO/}.

Numerically, if we measure the microscopic
cross section in $b$ where $1b=10^{-24}
cm^{-2}$, we can express the macroscopic cross section as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Sigma [cm^{-1}]  & = & \frac{6.02486 \times 10^{23} \rho
[g \: cm^{-3}] \sigma (E,Z,A) [b] \times 10^{-24}}{A} \\
& = & 0.602486 \: \frac{\rho [g \: cm^{-3}]}{A} \: \sigma (E,Z,A) [b]
\end{eqnarray}

which is the formula mostly used in {\tt GEANT}.
\subsection{Determination of the interaction point}
The mean free path of a particle for a given process,
$\lambda$, depends on the medium and cannot be used
directly to sample the probability of an interaction in a heterogeneous
detector. The number of mean free paths which a particle travels is:
\[
N_\lambda =\int \frac{dx}{\lambda(x)}
\]
and it is independent of the material traversed. If $N_R$ is
a random variable denoting the number of mean free paths from a given
point until the point of interaction, it can be shown that $N_R$ has the
distribution function
\[
P( N_R < N_\lambda ) = 1-e^{-N_\lambda}
\]
The total number of mean free paths the particle travels before
the interaction point, $N_\lambda$, is sampled at the beginning
of the trajectory as:
\begin{displaymath}
N_\lambda = -\log \left ( \eta \right )
\end{displaymath}
where $\eta$ is a random number uniformly distributed
in the range $(0,1)$.
$N_\lambda$ is updated after each step $\Delta x$ according the formula:
\begin{displaymath}
N'_\lambda=N_\lambda -\frac{\Delta x }{\lambda(x)}
\end{displaymath}
until the step originating from $s(x) = N_\lambda \lambda(x)$ is
the shortest and this triggers the specific process.

\end{verbatim}
The first 9 processes (from {\tt PAIR} production up to {\tt MU}on
{\tt NU}clear interaction) and the {\tt RAYL}eigh scattering and
{\tt L}ight {\tt ABS}orbtion
have the same scheme. Let's take as an example
the first one (for a complete description of the common see
{\tt [BASE030]}):
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMM}
\item[IPAIR ]flag for secondaries:
\begin{DLtt}{MMM}
\item[0=] the process is turned off;
\item[1=] generation of secondaries enabled;
\item[2=] no generation of secondaries.
\end{DLtt}
\item [SPAIR ] $ N_\lambda \lambda (x) \: = \: $
remaining track-length before interaction, evaluated at the last point
where the mechanism was active, i.e. {\tt IPAIR}$ \neq 0$.
\item[SLPAIR] track length at the time when the interaction last
happened for the current particle. Only {\tt SLPAIR}
(direct pair production by $\mu$), {\tt SLDRAY} ($\delta$-ray production),
{\tt SLBREM} (bremsstrahlung for $\mu$), {\tt SLHADR} (hadronic
interactions), {\tt SLMUNU} (muon-nucleus interactions) and {\tt SLRAYL}
(Rayleigh effect) are used.  The variables
{\tt SOLOSS}, {\tt STLOSS}, {\tt SOMULS}, {\tt STMULS} are obsolete. 
They have been kept for backward compatibility, but their value
is undefined and should not be used.
\item[ZINTPA] $N_\lambda \: = \: $remaining number of interaction
lengths (mean free paths)
evaluated at the last point where the mechanism was active, i.e.
{\tt IPAIR}$ \neq 0$.
\item[STEPPA] $ \lambda (x) \: = \:$value of the interaction length at the
last point where the mechanism was active, i.e. {\tt IPAIR}$ \neq 0$;
\end{DLtt}
The evaluation and update of the quantities like {\tt STEPPA, SPAIR} and
{\tt ZINTPA} are turned off in the media where the mechanism is not
active ($\mbox{\tt IPAIR} \neq 0$). Turning off a mechanism in one 
tracking medium may give incorrect physics results because
not only will the mechanism not be active, but the interaction
probabilities will not be updated, as if that medium had not been
traversed at all. This
feature of the tracking routines is used mainly in the vacuum, (defined
as a medium with atomic number $\mbox{\tt Z} < 1$), where all the mechanisms
but {\tt DECA}y (and {\tt SYNC}hrotron radiation, if activated) are inactive.
 
The {\tt DECA}y in flight is simpler since the mean life time of
the particle, $\tau$, is not material dependent and can be
sampled directly.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMM}
\item[SLIFE] not used.
\item[SUMLIF] proper time left before the decay. At the beginning of the
track $\mbox{\tt SUMLIF} \: = \: -c\tau \log \left  ( \eta \right )$.
\item[SDCAY] distance left to decay point evaluated at the last point
where the mechanism was active, i.e. $\mbox{\tt IDECA} \neq 0$.
\end{DLtt}
 
\section {Cross-section, energy loss and range tables}
Cross-sections, energy loss $dE/dx$ and range $R(E_{kin})$
are tabulated for all materials which enter in the definition of
a tracking medium by the routine \Rind{GPHYSI}.
The values of the energy for which the tabulated quantities are calculated
are stored in the common \FCind{/GCMULO/} (see {\tt [BASE030]}).
To evaluate one of the tabulated quantities for a particle of {\it kinetic}
energy $E_0$, a linear interpolation is used. Let $i$ be such that:
\[
E_i  < E_0 \leq E_{i+1}
\]
The integer variable
{\tt IEKBIN} in common \FCind{/GCTRACK/} is equal to $i$ during
tracking and its value is recomputed by the routine \Rind{GEKBIN} when
the energy of the particle changes. If the quantity $Y$ has been tabulated
so that $Y_i = Y(E_i)$ then the value $Y_0 = Y(E_0)$ is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
Y_0 = 
Y_i + \frac{E_0-E_i}{E_{i+1}-E_i} \left( Y_{i+1}-Y_i \right)
=  Y_i 
\left ( 1 - \frac{E_0-E_i}{E_{i+1}-E_i} \right ) +
Y_{i+1} \frac{E_0-E_i}{E_{i+1}-E_i}
\end{equation}

Inside the code the following quantities are used:

\[
\mbox{\tt GEKRAT} = 
\frac{E_0-E_i}{E_{i+1}-E_i} \hspace{4cm}
\mbox{\tt GEKRT1}  =  
\left ( 1 - \frac{E_0-E_i}{E_{i+1}-E_i} \right )
\]

where {\tt GEKRAT} is in common \FCind{/GCTRAK/} and {\tt GEKRT1} 
is a local variable recomputed when needed.

\section {The energy loss tables}
 
Energy loss and multiple
scattering are continuous processes that are applied at every step for
charged particles in matter ($\mbox{\tt Z} \geq 1$). 
 
As explained in {\tt [PHYS330]} and {\tt [PHYS430]},
energy loss tables are calculated at
initialisation time (\Rind{GPHYSI}) for all the materials which
enter in the definition of a tracking medium (see {\tt [CONS200]}).
These tables contain {\tt NEK1}
values of $dE/dx$ calculated for the corresponding values of energy
in {\tt ELOW}.
 
In case of mixtures/compounds, the rule~\cite{bib-PDGD} is to combine
the energy loss tables in GeV g$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$ according to
the proportion by weight of the elements, that is:

\[
\frac{dE}{dx} = \rho \sum_{i}{\frac{p_{i}}{\rho_{i}} \left (
\frac{dE}{dx} \right )_{i}}
\]

\section{Limitations on the step size}
The routine \Rind{GMULOF} called by \Rind{GPHYSI} creates and fills
a table of {\tt NEK1} values corresponding to the {\tt ELOW} values 
containing the smaller of the upper limits for the step 
imposed by the three continuous processes: energy
loss, multiple scattering and bending of the track induced by
the magnetic field.
 
Continuous energy loss can introduce an upper limit on the step via the
variable {\tt DEEMAX}, an argument to the \Rind{GSTMED} routine. During 
tracking the value of {\tt DEEMAX} for the current medium is stored in 
the common \FCind{/GCMATE/}. {\tt DEEMAX} is the maximum fraction of 
kinetic energy which a particle can lose in a step due to continuous 
ionisation ($0<\mbox{\tt DEEMAX}<1$). 
The limitation on the step size coming from {\tt DEEMAX} is:
\[ 
step \leq \frac{\mbox{\tt DEEMAX}}{dE/dx}
\]
 
Multiple scattering as well can limit the step size, see
{\tt [PHYS325]}. The limitation is given as:
\[ 
step \leq \min \left( T_{Bethe}, 10 \, X_0 \right)
\]
where $X_0$ is the radiation length and $T_{Bethe}$ is the maximum step
for which the Moli\`ere approximation is valid (see {\tt [PHYS325]}).
 
Another upper limit on the step size comes from the
magnetic field. The bending of the particle trajectory
in the magnetic field may be
limited by the {\tt TMAXFD} argument to the \Rind{GSTMED} routine.
During tracking the
value of {\tt TMAXFD} for the current medium is
stored in the common \FCind{/GCMATE/}.
 
A lower limitation on the tracking step is not generally imposed. There
is, however, a protection against the step being reduced to a very small
value by continuous processes. In particular multiple scattering at low
energies ($< 1$ MeV) can impose a very small tracking step with serious
consequences on the tracking time. To avoid this, a lower limit on the
step imposed by continuous processes is introduced: {\tt STMIN}.
The meaning of {\tt STMIN} is the following:
below 1 MeV
the stopping range is usually small. If the
stopping range becomes smaller than {\tt STMIN}, the constraint imposed
by the multiple scattering is ignored and the minimum is taken between
the reduced stopping range (the distance the particle has to travel
to reach its threshold energy) and {\tt STMIN} itself. In this sense 
{\tt STMIN} is no more than a tracking accelerator for stopping 
particles.
 
Another limitation on the step size which is imposed by the tracking
routines during transport is the {\tt STEMAX} parameter of
\Rind{GSTMED} which sets an absolute upper limit to the size of a
step for each tracking medium.
 
\section{Automatic calculation of parameters}
The definition of a {\it tracking medium} requires the specification
by the user of a set of parameters (see {\tt [CONS200]}) which can
critically affect the tracking and hence the physics results of the
{\tt GEANT} MonteCarlo. To help the user to find the optimal set of
parameters, by default {\tt GEANT} overrides the values of
{\tt STMIN, DEEMAX, STEMAX} and {\tt TMAXFD}. This behaviour is
controlled by the {\tt AUTO} data record and interactive command. By
default {\tt AUTO=1} and automatic evaluation of the parameters
is enforced (see below for the partly
anomalous behaviour of {\tt TMAXFD}). When {\tt AUTO}$=0$ then only those
parameters which are $ < 0$ are recalculated by {\tt GEANT}, while
for the others the user input is accepted with minimal checking.
 
When the automatic calculation of parameters is active, the following
applies:

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMM}
\item[DEEMAX] The formula used by {\tt GEANT} is the following: \\

\[ \mbox{\tt DEEMAX} \: = \: \left\{ \begin{array}{L@{\hspace{1cm}}cLcL}
  0.25 & \mbox{if} & \mbox{\tt ISVOL}=0 & \mbox{and} &
                       X_0<2 \: \mbox{cm} \\
  0.25-\frac{0.2}{\sqrt{X_0}} & \mbox{if} & \mbox{\tt ISVOL}=0 & \mbox{and} &
                       X_0 \geq 2 \: \mbox{cm} \\
  \frac{0.2}{\sqrt{X_0}} & \mbox{if} & \mbox{\tt ISVOL} \neq 0 & &  \\[4mm]
                   \end{array} \right .
\]

$\mbox{\tt ISVOL} > 0$ defines a {\it sensitive} detector, while 
$\mbox{\tt ISVOL} \leq 0$ is a non-{\it sensitive} detector (see {\tt [HITS]}).
 
\item[STMIN] The default value corresponds to a stopping 
range of 200 keV above {\tt CUTELE}.
 
\item[TMAXFD] The default value corresponds to $20^{\circ}$ if the
input value to \Rind{GSTMED} is $\leq 0$ or $> 20^{\circ}$, otherwise
the input value is taken.
 
\item[STEMAX] The default value is $10^{10}$ ({\tt BIG} variable
in common \FCind{/GCONST/}).
\end{DLtt}

These values have been tuned empirically on a variety of setups and
users are invited to start with automatic computation. The values of the
parameters can be checked with a call to {\tt GPRINT('TMED',0)} after
\Rind{GPHYSI} has been called. Use of {\tt AUTO} mode is strongly
recommended because it makes {\tt GEANT} a predictive tool. In this way
all parameters are automatically computed by the system as opposed to
tuning data and MonteCarlo via the tracking parameters.
 
\section{Energy loss}
\subsection{Energy loss tables}
In previous versions of {\tt GEANT} (up to version 3.13) the energy lost by
a charged particle travelling through matter was calculated by the
formula:
\[ \Delta E = \frac{dE}{dx} \: \times \: step
\]
The quantity $dE/dx$ was calculated and tabulated for $e^{\pm}$,
$\mu^{\pm}$ and protons and the value for a particle of a given energy
$E_0$ was calculated interpolating linearly the tables:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left. \frac{dE}{dx} \right|_{E=E_0} & = &
\left. \frac{dE}{dx} \right|_{E=E_i} + \frac{E_0-E_i}{E_{i+1}-E_i}
\left ( \left. \frac{dE}{dx} \right|_{E=E_{i+1}} -
\left. \frac{dE}{dx} \right|_{E=E_i} \right ) \vspace{.3cm} \\[5mm]
& = & \mbox{\tt GEKRT1} \times \left. \frac{dE}{dx} \right|_{E=E_i} +
\mbox{\tt GEKRAT} \times \left. \frac{dE}{dx} \right|_{E=E_{i+1}}
\hspace{2.5cm} (E_i < E_0 \leq E_{i+1})
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
These formula work of course on the assumption that the error is
negligible. But the error on the linear approximation is ${\cal O}
\left ( \partial^2E/\partial x \; \partial E \right )$ which is 
far from negligible at
low energy. In this way the energy loss at low energies was constantly
underestimated and the particles could travel too far before stopping.
 
\subsection{Stopping range tables}
To correct for this problem, a different approach was introduced in
{\tt GEANT} version 3.14. The {\it stopping range} of a particle is
defined as the distance that the particle will travel before stopping.
By definition the stopping range for a particle of energy $E_0$ is given
by:
\[ R = \int_{E_0}^{0}{\frac{dx}{dE} \: dE} =
\int_0^{E_0}{-\frac{dx}{dE} \: dE}
\]
Note that in the tables the positive quantity $-dE/dx$ is stored. The
method used was to build a table of stopping ranges based on {\tt ELOW}
by integrating the inverse of the $dE/dx$ tables in \Rind{GRANGI}.
At tracking time the algorithm was the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluate the stopping range for the threshold energy ({\tt STOPC}).
This was done only once at the beginning of each new track.
\item From the energy of the particle derive the stopping range by
a linear interpolation of the range table:
\[ R_0 = \mbox{\tt GEKRT1} \times R_i + \mbox{\tt GEKRAT} \times R_{i+1} \]
where $E_i < E_0 \leq E_{i+1}$.
\item Evaluate the stopping range for the particle after the step:
$R'_0 = R_0 - step$. If this is less than the stopping range of a
particle with threshold energy, the particle is terminated as a stopping
particle below the energy cut. Otherwise the following quantities are
evaluated:
\[
R_j < R'_0 \leq R_{j+1} \hspace{2cm}
\mbox{\tt GEK} = \displaystyle{\frac{R'_0-R_j}{R_{j+1}-R_j}}  \hspace{2cm}
\mbox{\tt GEK1} = 1 - \mbox{\tt GEK}
\]
and the final energy is computed as:
\[ E'_0 = \mbox{\tt GEK1} \times \mbox{\tt ELOW(}j\mbox{\tt )} +
          \mbox{\tt GEK} \times \mbox{\tt ELOW(}j\mbox{\tt +1)}
\]
\item the energy loss is computed as:
\[
\Delta E = E_0-E'_0 \]
This value is then corrected to take into account the energy loss
fluctuations (see {\tt [PHYS332]}).
\end{enumerate}
This method has two main disadvantages. The first is due to the finite
precision of computers. As the energy loss in a step is calculated as
the difference of two numbers, it is subject to large relative errors.
The effect can be particularly serious in the case of light materials,
particles near the minimum ionisation point or with very short steps, 
where $\Delta E = \mbox{\tt DESTEP}$ can even result in a negative
quantity. As the relative precision of a 32-bit computer is around
$10^{-6}$, the error on the energy loss of a 100 GeV
track can be as large as 100 keV.
 
The second problem connected with this method can be easily shown
if we compute $dE/dx$ as:
\[
\begin{array}{RCL}
\frac{dE}{dx} & = & \frac{d}{dx} \left(E_0 -E'_0 \right ) \: =  \:
\frac{d}{dx} \left(E_0 - \mbox{\tt GEK1} \times 
\mbox{\tt ELOW(}j\mbox{\tt )}
-\mbox{\tt GEK} \times \mbox{\tt ELOW(}j\mbox{\tt +1)} \right ) \\[5mm]
& = & \frac{d}{dx} \left(E_0 - E_j - \frac{R'_0-R_j}{R_{j+1}-R_j}
                    \left(E_{j+1}-E_j \right ) \right ) \:  =  \:
-\frac{d}{dx}\frac{\Delta E_j}{\Delta R_j} \left(R'_0-R_j \right) \\[5mm]
& = & -\frac{\Delta E_j}{\Delta R_j}\frac{dR'_0}{dx} \: =   \:
\frac{\Delta E_j}{\Delta R_j}\frac{step}{dx} \: = \:
\frac{\Delta E_j}{\Delta R_j} 
\end{array}
\]
As we can see, the reconstructed $dE/dx$ curve due to continuous energy loss
is a step function and constant in each energy bin. Thus, although the 
results 
obtained with {\tt GEANT 3.14} were very satisfactory, this was felt to be 
an undesirable feature.
 
\subsection{Energy loss in {\tt GEANT}}
The two problems mentioned above have been solved in {\tt GEANT 3.15}. As
far as the precision is concerned, the solution was to revert to the
algorithm of {\tt GEANT 3.13} every time the relative energy loss in the
step ({\tt DESTEP/GEKIN}) is smaller than five times the machine precision.
This has given good results without loosing the substantial improvements
obtained in {\tt GEANT 3.14} with the introduction of the stopping range
algorithm. As a matter of fact, the above condition happens only the 
in the case of 
very small steps or when the $dE/dx$ curve is very flat, and in both cases
the algorithm based on the $dE/dx$ tables is a good approximation.
 
The second problem has been solved by changing the interpolation algorithm,
going from a linear to a quadratic interpolation. Instead of assuming
a linear relation between energy and stopping range in every energy bin,
we assume a quadratic relation of the sort:
\[ E \: = \: f(R) \: = \: {\rm a} R^2 + {\rm b} R + {\rm c} \]
The only problem now is the determination of the coefficients a, b and
c. To do this we recall that the general formula of the parabola which
passes through the points $(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), (x_3,y_3)$ is the
following:
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & \displaystyle{
\frac{(x-x_2)(x-x_3)}{(x_1-x_2)(x_1-x_3)}y_1 +
\frac{(x-x_1)(x-x_3)}{(x_2-x_1)(x_2-x_3)}y_2 +
\frac{(x-x_1)(x-x_2)}{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)}y_3} \vspace{.3cm} \\
& = & \displaystyle{
\makebox[.5cm][r]{$x^2$} \left ( \frac{y_1}{(x_1-x_2)(x_1-x_3)}+
            \frac{y_2}{(x_2-x_1)(x_2-x_3)}+
            \frac{y_3}{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)} \right ) -} \vspace{.3cm} \\
&   & \displaystyle{
\makebox[.5cm][r]{$x$} \left ( \frac{y_1(x_2+x_3)}{(x_1-x_2)(x_1-x_3)}+
            \frac{y_2(x_1+x_3)}{(x_2-x_1)(x_2-x_3)}+
            \frac{y_3(x_1+x_2)}{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)} \right ) +}
                                                       \vspace{.3cm} \\
&   & \displaystyle{
\makebox[.5cm][r]{} \left ( \frac{y_1x_2x_3}{(x_1-x_2)(x_1-x_3)}+
            \frac{y_2x_1x_3}{(x_2-x_1)(x_2-x_3)}+
            \frac{y_3x_1x_2}{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)} \right )} \vspace{.3cm}
\end{eqnarray*}
This allows us to calculate and tabulate the coefficients a, b and c
just by replacing $y_i$ by {\tt ELOW(I)} and $x_i$ by the corresponding
stopping range {\tt ELOW(}$i${\tt )}.
In the routine \Rind{GRANGI} a table of length $3 \times (\mbox{\tt NEKBIN}
-1)$
is created: \\
 
\begin{tabular}{r@{}lcrcl}
{\tt Q(JINTRP+3*(I-1)} & {\tt +1)} & = &
${\rm a}({\tt R_I,R_{I+1},R_{I+2},E_I,E_{I+1},E_{I+2}})$
& = & ${\rm A_I}$  \vspace{.3cm} \\
& {\tt +2)} & = &
$\displaystyle{0.5 \,
\frac{{\rm b}({\tt R_I,R_{I+1},R_{I+2},E_I,E_{I+1},E_{I+2}})}
{{\rm a}({\tt R_I,R_{I+1},R_{I+2},E_I,E_{I+1},E_{I+2}})}}$
& = & ${\rm B_I}$ \vspace{.3cm} \\
& {\tt +3)} & = &
$\displaystyle{
\frac{{\rm c}({\tt R_I,R_{I+1},R_{I+2},E_I,E_{I+1},E_{I+2}})}
{{\rm a}({\tt R_I,R_{I+1},R_{I+2},E_I,E_{I+1},E_{I+2}})}}$
& = & ${\rm C_I}$ \vspace{.3cm} \\
\end{tabular}

where $E_I = \mbox{\tt ELOW(I)}$ and $\tt R_I = \mbox{\tt R(ELOW(I))}$.
The calculation of the energy loss is now done in the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluate the stopping range for the threshold energy ({\tt STOPC}),
only once at the beginning of each new particle tracking.
\item From the energy of the particle derive the stopping range by
a quadratic interpolation of the range table:
\[ R_0 = -{\rm B_I} + \frac{{\rm A_I}}{\left | {\rm A_I} \right |}
\: \sqrt{{\rm B_I}^2-\left ( {\rm C_I}-\frac{E_0}{{\rm A_I}}\right)}\]
The value of I is chosen according to the following. Let $i$ be such that
$\mbox{\tt ELOW(}{\rm i}\mbox{\tt )} < E_0 \leq \mbox{\tt ELOW(}{\rm i+1}
\mbox{\tt )}$:
\[ \mbox{\tt I} \: = \: \left\{ \begin{array}{LcL}
                    \max(i-1,1) & \mbox{if} &
\frac{E_0-\mbox{\tt ELOW(}{\rm i}\mbox{\tt )}}
{\mbox{\tt ELOW(}{\rm i+1}\mbox{\tt )}-
\mbox{\tt ELOW(}{\rm i}{\tt )}} < 0.7 \vspace{.3cm} \\
                    \min(i,\mbox{\tt NEKBIN}-1) & \mbox{if} &
\frac{E_0-\mbox{\tt ELOW(}{\rm i}\mbox{\tt )}}
{\mbox{\tt ELOW(}{\rm i+1}\mbox{\tt )}-
\mbox{\tt ELOW(}{\rm i}\mbox{\tt )}} \geq 0.7 \vspace{.3cm}
                  \end{array} \right .
\]
The value of $0.7$ is an empirical number which minimises the 
discontinuities of the reconstructed $dE/dx$ curve.
\item Evaluate the stopping range for the particle after the step:
$R'_0 = R_0 - step$. If this is less than the stopping range of a
particle of threshold energy, the particle is terminated as a stopping
particle below the energy cut. Otherwise, the final energy is computed as:
\[ E'_0 = {\rm A_I}\left({\rm C_I}+R'_0\left(2{\rm B_I}+R'_0\right)\right)
\]
\item the energy loss is computed as:
\[
\Delta E = E_0-E'_0 \]
This value is then corrected to take into account the energy loss
fluctuations (see {\tt [PHYS332]}).
\end{enumerate}
This method results in a $dE/dx$ curve which is a set of connected
straight lines and not a step function.

The routine \Rind{GPHYSI} is called at initialisation time by the user
usually from the \Rind{UGINIT} routine (see example in {\tt [BASE100]}). 
The purpose of \Rind{GPHYSI} is twofold:
\begin{itemize}
\item print the parameters of the current run
\item compute the cross-section and energy loss tables and fill the
{\tt JMATE} data structure {\tt [CONS199]}.
\end{itemize}
\section {Print the run definitions }
 
\Rind{GPHYSI} prints the {\tt GEANT} version number and the 
{\tt ZEBRA}~\cite{bib-ZEBRA} version number stored
in the {\tt JRUNG} data structure {\tt [BASE299]} 
 
\Rind{GPHYSI} also prints the tracking and physics
parameters for the current run, which are stored in
the {\tt JTMED} data structure.
See the description of the {\tt JTMED} 
data structure in {\tt [CONS210]} and {\tt [CONS299]}.

The meaning of the printed values is described in the documentation of the
commons \FCind{/GCCUTS/} and \FCind{/GCPHYS/} in {\tt [BASE030]}.
Different values of the parameters can be assigned by the user to each
tracking medium (see {\tt [BASE100]}). The parameter definition in 
{\tt GEANT} proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
a default set of {\it global} values of the parameters is defined for 
all tracking media by the routine {\tt GINIT};
\item
the default values can be changed by the user via the data records read 
by the routine \Rind{GFFGO}. A summary of all valid data records is given 
in {\tt [BASE040]};
\item
after having defined tracking media and materials, the user can
redefine the parameters for
{\bf each medium} via the routine \Rind{GSTPAR} {\tt [CONS210]};
\item
if the data structures are read from an external file
(see {\tt IOPA} section),
all the parameters are taken from this file. In this case the user can
still modify them, but this should be done {\bf before} calling the
routine \Rind{GPHYSI}.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Compute cross-section and energy loss tables}
 
\Rind{GPHYSI} is the steering routine to compute the cross-section
and energy loss tables for all materials used as tracking media.
\Rind{GPHYSI} builds and fills the {\tt JMATE} data structure described in
{\tt [CONS199]}. Here, we give the flow chart of this process.
The description of the specialised routines can be found in the
rest of the section {\tt PHYS}.
 
{\bf Note}:
     if  several tracking media are using the same material
(for instance a calorimeter and a chamber support can be both in steel)
the energy cuts must be the same. If this is not possible,
the user must define materials with different numbers.

{\bf Notes}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The $\mu$-nucleus interactions are treated
{\bf either} as a continuous energy loss by the muon ({\tt IMUNU}$=0$)
{\bf or} as a discrete process ({\tt IMUNU}$\geq$1),
{\bf in an exclusive way} i.e.:
\begin{itemize}
\item If {\tt IMUNU}$=0$, the $dE/dx$ due to the interactions is added
to that coming from direct ($ e^+/e^-$) pair production in the routine 
\Rind{GPRELA}.
\item
If {\tt IMUNU}$\geq 1$, the total cross section is computed in 
\Rind{GMUNUI}.
\end{itemize}
\item
The total cross sections for hadronic interactions cannot be tabulated at
initialisation time, as they are dependent on the nature
of the incident particle. They are computed at tracking time by the function
\Rind{FLDIST} in case of {\tt FLUKA} {\tt [PHYS520]}, \Rind{GHESIG} 
in case of {\tt GHEISHA} {\tt [PHYS510]} or \Rind{FMDIST} in case of {\tt MICAP}

\Makehead{Total cross-section for \Pem\Pep-pair production by photons}
\section{Subroutines} 
\Shubr{GPRSGA}{}
{\tt GPRSGA} calculates the total cross-section for
the pair production of photons and the direct pair production of muons
in all materials. It tabulates the mean free path, $\lambda =
1/\Sigma$ (in cm), as a function of the medium and the energy.
For the pair production by photons, it calls the function 
\Rind{GPRSGG}. The energy
bins are the one of the array {\tt ELOW} in common \FCind{/CGMULO/}
initialised in the
routine \Rind{GPHYSI}. The following pointers are used:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM}
\item[JMA = LQ(JMATE-I)]  pointer to the I$^{th}$ material
\item[JPAIR = LQ(JMA-10)] pointer to pair production cross-sections
\end{DLtt}
\Rind{GPRSGA} is called at initialisation time by \Rind{GPHYSI}.

\Sfunc{GPRSGG}{VALUE = GPRSGG(Z,E)}
\Rind{GPRSGG} calculates the total cross-section for
the pair production of a photon with energy {\tt E} in material
with atomic number {\tt Z}. It is called by \Rind{GPRSGA}.

\section{Method}
 
We have parameterised the total cross-section of \Pep\Pem-pair
production by photon as:
 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(Z,E_\gamma) = Z(Z+1) \:(F_1(X) + F_2(X) Z +
F_3(X)/Z)  \mbox{\quad (barn/atom)}
\label{eq:phys210-1}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{tabular}[t]{p{1.3cm}ll}
$X$           & = & $\ln(E_\gamma/m)$,\\
$m$           & = & electron mass,\\
$E_\gamma$    & = & photon energy \\
\end{tabular}

and

\begin{tabular}[t]{p{1.3cm}ll}
$F_i(X)$      & = & $\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^5 c_n X^n$ \\
\end{tabular}
 
The parameters $c_n$ were taken from a least-square fit to the data 
\cite{bib-HUBB}
and can be found in the {\tt DATA} statement in the 
function \Rind{GPRSGG(Z,E)} which
computes the formula (\ref{eq:phys210-1}) (in barn/atom).
 
This parameterisation gives a good description of the data in the
range:
 
\begin{equation}
\left . \begin{array}{c} 1\leq Z\leq 100 \\
1.5 \; \mbox{MeV} \leq E_\gamma\leq 100 \; \mbox{GeV} 
\end{array} \right \} \hspace{0.5cm}
\frac{ \Delta\ \sigma}{\sigma}\leq 5\% 
        \mbox{\hspace{0.5cm} with a mean value of} \approx 2.2\% 
\end{equation}
 
This mean free path is tabulated at initialisation as a function
of the medium and of the energy by the routine \Rind{GPRSGA}.

\Makehead{Simulation of \Pem\Pep-pair production by photons}

\section{Subroutines}
\Shubr{GPAIRG}{}

\Rind{GPAIRG} generates \Pem\Pep-pair production by photons.
It uses a modified version
of the random number techniques of Butcher and Messel \cite{bib-BUTC}
to sample the secondary electron/positron energies from the Coulomb
corrected Bethe-Heitler differential cross-section.
For the angular distribution of the pair, it calls the function
\Rind{GBTETH}.

Input:    via COMMON \FCind{/GCTRAK/}

Output:   via COMMON \FCind{/GCKING/}

\Rind{GPAIRG} is called from \Rind{GTGAMA},
when the photon reaches its pair production point.

\Sfunc{GBTETH}{VALUE = GBTETH(ENER,PARTM,EFRAC)}
\Rind{GBTETH} calculates the angular distribution of the \Pem\Pep-pair
for pair production and of the photon for bremsstrahlung.
In case of \Pem\Pep-pair production by photons, it gives the
scaled angle for an electron (mass {\tt PARTM}) of energy {\tt ENER}
which is {\tt EFRAC} times the initial energy of the photon.
\Rind{GBTETH} is called by \Rind{GPAIRG}.

\section{ Method}

\subsection{MonteCarlo technique}
We give a very short summary of the random number technique used here
\notHTML{\cite{bib-BUTC,bib-HAMM}}\HTML{\cite{bib-BUTC}, \cite{bib-HAMM}}.
The method is a combination of the composition and
rejection Monte Carlo methods. Suppose we wish to sample $x$ from
the distribution $f(x)$ and the
(normalised) probability density function can be written as
\begin{equation}
f(x)  = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha _{i} f _{i} (x) g_{i} (x)
\end{equation}

where $f _i (x)$ are normalised density functions, $\alpha _i > 0 $ and
$ 0 \leq g_i (x) \leq 1 $.

According to this method, $x$ can sampled in the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
select a random integer $i$ such that $(1\leq i \leq n)$
with probability proportional to $\alpha_i $
\item
select a value $x'$ from the distribution $f_i (x)$
\item
calculate $g_i (x')$ and accept $x = x'$ with probability
$g_i (x')$;
\item if $x'$ is rejected restart from step 1.
\end{enumerate}
It can be shown that this scheme is correct and the mean
number of tries to accept a value is $ \sum_{i}\alpha_i $.

In practice we have a good method of sampling from the distribution $f(x)$, if
\begin{itemize}
\item all the subdistributions $ f_i (x)$ can be sampled easily;
\item the rejection functions $ g_i(x)$ can be evaluated easily/quickly;
\item the mean number of tries is not too large.
\end{itemize}
Thus the different possible decompositions of the distribution
$f(x)$ are not equivalent from the practical point of view (e.g. they
can be very different in computational speed) and it can be very useful
to optimise the decomposition.
A remark of practical importance is that if our distribution is not
normalised ($\int f(x)dx=C>0; C\approx 1$), the method can be used in the same
manner, the only difference is that the mean number of tries in this
case is given by  $\sum_ {i}\alpha_i/C$ .

\subsection{Differential cross-section for pair production}
The Bethe-Heitler differential cross-section with the Coulomb correction for
a photon of energy $E$ to produce a \Pem\Pep-pair with one of the
particles having
energy  $ \epsilon E$  ($ \epsilon$ is the fraction of the
photon energy carried by one particle of the pair)
is given as in \cite{bib-EGS3}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma (Z,E,\epsilon )}{d \epsilon} =
     \frac{r_0^2\alpha Z [ Z +\xi (Z) ]}{E^2}
     \left\{[\epsilon^ 2 + ( 1 -\epsilon ) ^ 2 ] [ \Phi _1 (\delta ) -F (Z) ] +
     \frac{2}{3}\epsilon (1-\epsilon ) [\Phi_2 (\delta ) -F (Z) ] \right\}
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_i(\delta)$ are the screening functions
depending on the screening variable $\delta$\\
\[ \begin{array}{LL}

\delta  =  \frac { 136m}{ Z^{1/3}E}
            \frac{ 1}{ \epsilon(1-\epsilon)}
              &        m = \mbox{electron mass} \\
& \\
\hspace{-.2cm}
\left.\begin{array}{L}
\Phi_1(\delta)  =  20.867 - 3.242\delta +0.625\delta^2  \\
\Phi_2(\delta)  =  20.209 - 1.930\delta - 0.086\delta^2  \\
\end{array}        \right\} & \; \delta\leq 1 \\
\Phi_1(\delta) = \Phi_2(\delta) =
21.12 - 4.184 \ln(\delta+0.952)
                    & \; \delta > 1  \\
&\\

\alpha  & = & 1/137
\end{array} \]

The kinematical range for the variable $\epsilon$ is
\begin{equation}
\frac {m}{E} \leq \epsilon  \leq 1 - \frac{m}{E}
\end{equation}
The cross-section is symmetric with respect to
the interchange of $\epsilon$ with
$1-\epsilon $, so we can restrict $\epsilon $ to lie in the range
 $\epsilon_0  = m/E\leq \epsilon \leq 1/2 $

After some algebraic manipulations we can decompose the cross-section
as (note: the normalisation is not important):
\[ \begin{array}{LCLLCL}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\epsilon} & = &
\sum^{2}_{i=1}\alpha_i f_i (\epsilon) g_i (\epsilon) \\
\end{array} \]

where

\[ \begin{array}{LCLLCL}
\alpha_1 & = & \frac{(0.5 - \epsilon_0)^2}{3} F_{10} &
\alpha_2 & = & \frac{1}{2}F_{20}    \\
\\
f_1 (\epsilon)& =&
\frac{ 3}{ (0.5 - \epsilon_0)}(\epsilon-0.5)^2  &
f_2 (\epsilon)& =& \frac{ 1}{ 0.5-\epsilon_0}    \\
g_1 (\epsilon)&     =&  F_1 / F_{10}      &
g_2 (\epsilon)&  = & F_2 / F_{20}        \\
\end{array} \]

and

\[ \begin{array}{LCLLCL}
F_1   &   = & F_1(\delta) = 3\Phi_1(\delta)-\Phi_2(\delta)-2F(Z)       &
F_{10}  & = & F_1(\delta_{min})                                          \\
F_2  &  = & F_2(\delta) = \frac{3}{2}\Phi_1(\delta)+
                        \frac{1}{2}\Phi_2(\delta)-2F(Z)            &
F_{20}  & = & F_2(\delta_{min})                                          \\
\\
\delta_{min} & = & 4\frac{ 136m}{ Z^{\frac{1}{3}}3E} & \\
\end{array} \]

$\delta_{min}$ is the minimal value of the
screening variable $\delta$. It can be
seen that the functions $f_i(\epsilon)$ are normalised and
that the functions $ g_i(\epsilon)$ are ``valid" rejection functions.

Therefore, if $r_i$ are uniformly distributed random numbers
($0\leq r_i  \leq 1$), we can sample the
$\epsilon $ ($x$ in the program) in the following way:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
select $i$ to be 1 or 2 according to the following ratio:
\[
\mbox{\tt BPAR}  = \frac{ \alpha_1 }{\alpha_1 +\alpha_2}
\]
If $r_0 < \mbox{\tt BPAR}$ then $i=1$, otherwise if $r_0\geq \mbox{\tt BPAR}$ 
$i=2$;
\item
sample $\epsilon$  from $f_1(\epsilon)$. This can be
performed by the following expressions:

\[
\epsilon = \left\{
\begin{array}{Ll}
0.5 \left[ 1- (0.5 - \epsilon_0 ) ( 1- r_1 )^\frac{1}{3}\right] &
\mbox{when $i=1$} \\
\epsilon_0 + \left(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon_0\right) r_1 &
\mbox{when $i=2$}
\end{array} \right.
\]
\item calculate the rejection function $g_1(\epsilon)$.
If $r_2\leq g_{i}(\epsilon)$, accept $ \epsilon$, otherwise return
to step 1.
\end{enumerate}

It should be mentioned that we need a step just after sampling $ \epsilon $
in the step 2, because the cross-section formula becomes
negative at large $ \delta$
and this imposes an upper limit
for $ \delta$;
\[
\delta_{max} = \exp \left[\frac{21.12-F(Z)}{4.184}\right] - 0.962
\]

If we get a $\delta$ value using the sampled $\epsilon$ such that
$\delta > \delta_{max} $ , we
have to start again from the step 1.
After the successful sampling of $\epsilon $, \Rind{GPAIRG}
generates the polar angles
of the electron with respect to an axis defined along the direction
of the parent photon.
The electron and the positron are assumed to have
a symmetric angular distribution.
The energy-angle distribution is given by
Tsai~\notHTML{\cite{bib-TSAI,bib-TSAI-err}}\HTML{\cite{bib-TSAI}, \cite{bib-TSAI-err}}
as following:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d \sigma}{dpd \Omega}
& = & \frac{2 \alpha^2e^2}{\pi k m^4}
      \left\{ \left[ \frac{2x(1-x)}{(1+l)^2}-\frac{12lx(1-x)}{(1+l)^4}\right]
      (Z^{2}+Z) \nonumber  \right. \\
&   & \mbox{} + \left. \left[ \frac{2x^2-2x+1}{(1+l)^2} +
      \frac{4lx(1-x)}{(1+l)^4}
      \right]
      \left[ X-2Z^{2}f((\alpha Z)^{2})\right]
      \right\} \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

where $k$ is the photon energy, $p$ and $E$  are the momentum and
the energy of the electron of the $e^+e^-$-pair,
$x=E/k$  and $l = E^{2} \theta^{2}/m^{2}$. This distribution
is quite complicated to sample and, furthermore, considered as
function of the variable
$u = E \theta/m$, it shows a very weak dependence on $Z$, $E$, $k$,
$x = E/k$. Thus, the distribution can be approximated by a function
\begin{equation}
f(u) = C \left( u e^{-au} + d u e^{-3au} \right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{eqnarray*}
C & = & \frac{9a^{2}}{9 + d} \\
a & = & 0.625 \\
d & = & 27.0 
\end{eqnarray*}
The sampling of the function $f(u)$ can be done in the following way
($r_{i}$ are uniformly distributed random numbers
in [0,1]):
\begin{enumerate}
\item choose between $u e^{-au}$ and $d u e^{-3au}$, with relative
probability given by $9/(9+d)$ and $d/(9+d)$ respectively;
if $r_{1} < 9/(9+d)$ then $b=a$, else $b=3a$;
\item sample $u e^{-bu}$, $u=-(\ln r_{2} + \ln r_{3})/b$.
\end{enumerate}

The azimuthal angle, $\phi$, is generated isotropically.

This information together with the momentum conservation is used to calculate
the momentum vectors of both decay products and to transform
them to the {\tt GEANT} coordinate system.
The choice of which particle in the pair is the electron/positron is
made randomly.

\subsection{Restrictions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Effects due to the breakdown of Born approximation at low energies
are ignored (but the Coulomb correction is now included):
\item
as suggested by Ford and Nelson~\cite{bib-EGS4}, for very low energy 
photons ($E\leq 2.1 MeV$) the electron energy is approximated by sampling 
from a uniform distribution over the interval $ m\rightarrow 1/(2E)$.
The reason for this suggestion is that the sampling method used in 
EGS and in the earlier {\tt GEANT} versions becomes progressively more 
inefficient as the pair threshold is approached. This is not true for 
the sampling method outlined above (the efficiency of the method 
practically does not depend on the photon energy), but we
have chosen to keep this approximation;
\item
target materials composed of compounds or mixtures are treated identically
to chemical elements (this is not the case when computing the mean free path!)
using the effective atomic number computed in the routine \Rind{GSMIXT}. 
It can be shown that the error of this type of treatment is small and can 
be neglected;
\item
the differential cross-section implicitly accounts for pair production
in both nuclear and atomic electron fields. However, triplet production
is not generated, and the recoil momentum of the target nucleus/electron
is assumed to be zero.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Subroutines} 
\Shubr{GCOMPI}{}
 
{\tt GCOMPI} calculates the total cross-section for Compton
scattering. It tabulates the mean free path, $\lambda =
\frac{1}{\Sigma}$ (in cm), as a function
of the medium and of the energy (see {\tt JMATE} data structure).
The energy binning is set within the array {\tt ELOW} (common
\FCind{/GCMULO/}) in the routine \Rind{GPHYSI}.
{\tt GCOMPI} is called at initialisation time by {\tt GPHYSI}.
 
\section{Method}
 
The mean free path, $\lambda$, for a photon to interact via Compton
scattering is given by
\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{\Sigma} = \frac{A}{N_{Av}\rho}\frac{1}{\sigma(Z,E)}
\]
where:
\begin{eqnarray*}
N_{Av} &  & \mbox{Avogadro's number} \\
Z,A &  & \mbox{atomic and mass number of the medium} \\
\rho &  & \mbox{density of the medium} \\
\sigma &  & \mbox{total cross-section per atom for Compton scattering} \\
E &  & \mbox{energy of the photon.}
\end{eqnarray*}
 
For the total cross-section an empirical cross-section formula
is used which reproduces the cross-section data rather well down to 10 keV:
\[
\sigma(Z,E) = Z \left [ P_{1}(Z) \frac{\log(1+2X)}{X} +
\frac{P_{2}(Z)+P_{3}(Z) X + P_{4}(Z) X^{2}}{1+aX+bX^{2}+cX^{3}} \right ]
\mbox{barn atom}^{-1} 
\]
where
\begin{eqnarray*}
m & = & \mbox{electron mass}  \\
X & = & \frac{E}{m}  \\
P_{i}(Z) & = & D_{i} + E_{i}Z + F_{i}Z^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}
 
The values of the parameters are put in 
the {\tt DATA} statement within the routine \Rind{GCOMPI}.
The fit was made over 511 data points chosen between:
\[
1 \leq Z \leq 100 \makebox[2cm]{;} 10 \: \mbox{keV} \leq E \leq 100 \: 
\mbox{GeV}
\]
 
The accuracy of the fit is estimated to be:
 
\vspace{.3cm}
\[
\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma} = \left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
\approx 10\% & \makebox[2cm][r]{\rm for E} & \simeq 10\: \mbox{keV}-20\: 
\mbox{keV} \vspace{.3cm} \\
\leq 5-6\% & \makebox[2cm][r]{\rm for E} & > 20 \: \mbox{keV}
\end{array} \right.

\section{Subroutines}
\Shubr{GCOMP}{}
\Rind{\tt GCOMP} generates the Compton scattering of a photon on an 
atomic electron. It uses the random number techniques of Butcher and 
Messell \cite{bib-BUTC} to sample the scattered photon energy according 
to the Klein-Nishina formula \cite{bib-KLEI}.

The interaction produces one electron, which is put in the \FCind{/GCKING/} 
common block for further tracking. Tracking of the scattered photon will
continue, with direction and energy changed by the interaction.
All input/output information is through {\tt GEANT} common blocks.
 
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Input: & via COMMON \FCind{/GCTRACK/} \\
Output: & via COMMONs \FCind{/GCTRAK/} and \FCind{/GCKING/} 
\end{tabular}
 
Compton scattering is selected in {\tt GEANT} by the input data 
record {\tt COMP}. When Compton scattering is selected, \Rind{GCOMP} 
is called automatically from the {\tt GEANT} photon tracking
routine \Rind{GTGAMA}.

\section {Method}
 
For a complete account of the Monte Carlo methods used the
interested
user is referred to the publications of Butcher and Messel 
\cite{bib-BUTC}, Messel
and Crawford \cite{bib-MESS} and Ford and Nelson \cite{bib-EGS3}.
Only the basic formalism is outlined here.
 
The quantum  mechanical Klein-Nishina differential cross-section
is:
\[
\Phi(E,E') =\frac{X_0 n \pi r_0^2 m_{\rm e}}{E^2}
     \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon}+\epsilon\right]
     \left[1 - \frac{\epsilon \sin^2 \theta}{1+\epsilon^2}\right]
\]
where,\quad
\begin{tabular}[t]{l@{\ = \ }l}
$E$         & energy of the incident photon   \\
$E'$        & energy of the scattered photon  \\
$\epsilon$  & $E'/E$                          \\
$m_{e}$     & electron mass                   \\
$n$         & electron density                \\
$r_0$       & classical electron radius       \\
$X_0$       & radiation length
\end{tabular}
 
Assuming an elastic collision, the scattering angle $\theta$ is
defined by the Compton formula:
 
\[
E'   = E \frac{m_{\rm e}}{ m_{\rm e} + E(1-\cos\theta )}
\]
 
Using the combined ``composition and rejection'' Monte Carlo methods
described in chapter {\tt PHYS211}, we may set:
 
\[
\begin{array}{LcLLcL}
f(\epsilon)   & = & \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon}+\epsilon\right] =
                    \sum^{2}_{i=1} \alpha_i f_i(E)
                    &  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\mbox{for}}
                    & \epsilon_0 > \epsilon > 1     \\
g(\epsilon)   & = & \left[ 1 - \frac{\epsilon\sin^2\theta}{1+\epsilon^2}
                    \right] & \multicolumn{3}{l}{\mbox{rejection function}} \\
\alpha_1      & = & \frac{1}{\ln(1/\epsilon_0)}   &
\alpha_2      & = & \frac{1}{2} (1-\epsilon_0^2)                             \\
f_1(\epsilon) & = & \frac{1}{\epsilon\ln(1/\epsilon_0)} &
f_2(\epsilon) & = & \frac{2\epsilon}{1-\epsilon^2}
\end{array}
\]
 
The value of $\epsilon$ corresponding to the minimum
photon energy (backward scattering) is given by:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\epsilon_0 & = & \frac{1}{1+2E/m_{\rm e}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Given a set of random numbers $r_i$ uniformly distributed in [0,1],
the sampling procedure for $\epsilon$ is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
decide which element of the $f(\epsilon)$ distribution to sample from.
Let $\alpha_T = (\alpha_1+\alpha_2)r_0$. If $\alpha_1\geq\alpha_T$
select $f_1(\epsilon)$, otherwise select $f_2(\epsilon)$;
 
\item  sample $\epsilon$ from the distributions
corresponding to $f_1$ or $f_2$. For $f_1$ this is simply achieved by:
\[
\epsilon = \epsilon_0 e^\alpha_1 r_1
\]
For $f_2$, we change variables and use:
\[
\epsilon' = \left\{ \begin{array}{lll}
\max(r_2,r_3) & \mbox{for } & E/m \geq (E/m+1)r_4 \\
r_5           & \multicolumn{2}{l}{\mbox{for all other cases}}
 \end{array} \right.
\]
Then, $\epsilon = \epsilon_0+(1-\epsilon_0)\epsilon'$;
 
\item calculate $\sin^2\theta = \max(0,t(2-t))$ 
where $t=m_{\rm e}(1-\epsilon)/E'$ 

\item test the rejection function, if $r_6 \leq g(\epsilon)$ accept
$\epsilon$, otherwise return to step 1.
\end{enumerate}

After the successful sampling of $\epsilon$, \Rind{GCOMP} generates the
polar angles of the scattered photon with respect to the direction of
the parent photon. The azimuthal angle, $\phi$, is generated isotropically and
$\theta$ is as defined above. The momentum vector of the scattered
photon is then calculated according to kinematic considerations. Both
vectors are then transformed into the {\tt GEANT} coordinate system.

\section{Restriction}
 
The differential cross-section is only valid for those
collisions in which the energy of the recoil electron is large compared
with its binding energy (which is ignored). However, as pointed out by
Rossi \cite{bib-ROSS}, this has a negligible effect 
because of the small number of
recoil electrons produced at very low energies.

\section{Method}
 
\subsection{Materials with ${\tt Z} \leq 100$}
For media with $Z \leq 100$
we use SANDIA parametrisation \cite{bib-SANDIA}.
The cross-section for elements
%with {\it Z} between 1 and 100
was fitted with a linear combination of reciprocal powers of the photon
energy $E_\gamma$ ($E_\gamma$ in keV). The fits were performed in different
intervals {\it j} of the photon energy. In such an interval the cross-section
reads as:
\begin{equation}
 \mu_{ij}  =  \frac{C_{1,ij}}{E_\gamma}+\frac{C_{2,ij}}{E_\gamma^2}
            +\frac{C_{3,ij}}{E_\gamma^3}+\frac{C_{4,ij}}{E_\gamma^4}
             \ \ \  (cm^{2}g^{-1})
\label{eq:sandia1}
\end{equation}
with {\it j} changing from 1 to $m_i$,
where $m_i$ is the number of fitting intervals used for element {\it i}.\\
%The photoelectric cross-section is given in centimeters squared per gram.
\par
For the composites or mixtures of N elements the cross-section for $j^{th}$
interval is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
 \mu_{j}  =  \sum_{k=1}^{N} f_k \mu_{j,k}
\label{eq:sandia2}
\end{equation}
where $f_k$ is the fraction by mass of k$^{th}$ element in the material.
Substituting (\ref{eq:sandia1}) into (\ref{eq:sandia2}) one finds that
the cross-section coefficients can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
 C_{i,total}  =  \sum_{k=1}^{N} f_k C_{i,jk}
\label{eq:sandia3}
\end{equation}
for {\tt i} from 1 to 4.
The macroscopic cross-section is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
 \Sigma  =  \rho\mu \ \ \ (cm^{-1})
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the medium density.
 
%Coefficients of (\ref{eq:sandia3}) are calculated in routine {\tt GPHXSI}.\\
As follows from (\ref{eq:sandia3}) each compound is decomposed to its
components which should coincide with chemical elements. If this is not
the case i.e. a component has a non-integer atomic number $Z_x$
and is created by a call to \Rind{GSMATE}
then the cross-section constants are calculated
using two elements with $Z_1 = integer(Z_x)$ and $Z_2 = Z_1+1$ applying the
weights $w_1 = Z_2-Z_x$ and $w_2 = Z_x-Z_1$ respectively.
 
\subsection{Materials with ${\tt Z} > 100$}
Originally the parametrisation described below
was developed for the elements with the atomic number {\tt Z} between 5 and 100.
Lacking more accurate data and
assuming that there are no dramatic changes of the cross-section 
behaviour this method
(i.e. \Rind{GPHSIG} function) is used for ${\tt Z} > 100$.
 
The  macroscopic cross-section  for an element is given by
\begin{equation}
\Sigma = \frac{ N \rho \sigma (Z,E_\gamma)}{ A}\ \ \ (cm^{-1})
\end{equation}
and for a compound or a mixture
\begin{equation}
\Sigma =\frac{ N \rho \sum_{i}\sigma (Z_i , E_\gamma)}
        {\sum_{i} n_i A_i }
 =    N \rho \sum_{i}\frac{p_i}{A_i}\sigma ( Z_i ,E_\gamma )\ \ \ (cm^{-1})
\end{equation}
where\\

               corresponding proportion by weight and $W$ is the 
               molecular weight).

The binding energy of the inner shells has been parameterised as:

\end{equation}
where, $ i = K, L_I, L_{II} $ and the constants $A_i, B_i, C_i$ and $D_i$
are tabulated below.\\

The photoelectric effect total cross-section has been parameterised as:

   p_{19} & \mbox{if\quad } 10 \; keV \leq E \leq E_{L_{II}}
  \end{array}\right.
\label{eq:urban1}
\end{equation}
where $X$ is the ratio of the electron mass to the incident photon energy
and $\sigma$ is expressed in barns/atom.\\
The fit was made over 301 data points chosen between
$5 \leq Z \leq 100\quad \mbox{and} \quad 10 \; keV \leq E \leq 50\; MeV $.
The values of the parameters are put in
a {\tt DATA} statement within the function \Rind{GPHSIG}
which computes the formula (\ref{eq:urban1}).
The accuracy of the fit is estimated to be
\begin{displaymath}
 \frac{\Delta}{\sigma} \leq 
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll} 25\% & \mbox{near to the peaks} \\
                          10\% & \mbox{elsewhere.}

\section{Photoelectric effect Bank}
 
The banks connected to the photoelectric effect are created during
initialisation for each tracking medium.
{\tt PHXS} bank (data area)
The total cross-section values are stored in {\tt PHOT} bank in energy bins
set within the array {\tt ELOW} (common \Cind{CGMULO}). This bank is pointed by
{\tt JPHOT} link. The first structural link of {\tt PHOT} supports the
{\tt PHXS} bank.
For each energy interval of the cross-section we store the upper limit of the
interval and four constants of equation (\ref{eq:sandia3}).
For each chemical element used to build the medium a {\tt PHFN} bank is created.
This bank, pointed by a structural link of the {\tt PHXS} bank, contains
the data needed for the photoelectric effect final state simulation.
All data word are of the Fortran REAL type.
The descriptions of the {\tt PHXS} and {\tt PHFN} banks are given below.

\section{Subroutines}
\Shubr{GPHOT}
{\tt GPHOT} simulates the photoelectric effect. It uses the following
input and output:
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMM}
\item[Input]{via common \Cind{GCTRAK}}
\item[Output]{via common \Cind{GCKING}}
\end{DLtt}
It calls the functions \Rind{GPHSG1}, \Rind{GPHSGP}, \Rind{GAVRL2}
and \Rind{GAVRL3} for the cross-section and the functions \Rind{GHPHAK},
\Rind{GHPHAL1}, \Rind{GHPHAL2}, \Rind{GPHAL3} for the cosine distribution 
of the photoelectron. \Rind{GPHOT} is called by the tracking routine
\Rind{GTGAMA}, if, and when, the photon reaches its interaction point.
\Sfunc{GAVRL2}{VALUE = GAVRL2(GAMAL2,BETAL2,X)}
\Rind{GAVRL2} calculates approximation of the cross-section for the 
photoelectric effect from $L_{II}$ shell. {\tt GAMAL2},
{\tt BETAL2} are the Lorentz gamma and beta factors of the emitted 
photoelectron and $X = m_e/E_\gamma$ where $m_e$ is
the electron mass and $E_\gamma$ is the incident radiation energy.
\Rind{GAVRL2} is called by \Rind{GHPOT}.
\Sfunc{GAVRL3}{VALUE = GAVRL3(GAMAL3,BETAL3,X)}
\Rind{GAVRL3} calculates approximation of the cross-section for the 
photoelectric effect from $L_{III}$ shell.
{\tt GAMAL3}, {\tt BETAL3} are the Lorentz gamma and beta factors of the 
emitted photoelectron and $X = m_e/E_\gamma$ where $m_e$ is the electron 
mass and $E_\gamma$ is the  incident radiation energy.
{\tt GAVRL3} is called by \Rind{GPHOT}.
\Sfunc{GPHAK}{VALUE = GPHAK(BETAK)}
\Sfunc{GPHAL1}{VALUE = GPHAL1(BETAL1)}
{\tt GPHAK} and its entry point {\tt GPHAL1} poll the cosine distribution 
(w.r.t. the incident photon direction) of the photoelectron emitted from 
$K$ or $L_{I}$ shell, respectively. They are called by \Rind{GPHOT}.
\Sfunc{GPHAL2}{VALUE = GPHAL2(BETAL2)}
\Rind{GPHAL2} polls the cosine distribution (w.r.t. the incident photon
direction) of the photoelectron emitted from $L_{II}$ shell.
\Sfunc{GPHAL3}{VALUE = GPHAL3(BETAL3)}
{\tt GPHAL3} polls the cosine distribution (w.r.t. the incident photon
direction) of the photoelectron emitted from $L_{III}$ shell.
It is called by \Rind{GPHOT}.
\Sfunc{GPHSGP}{VALUE = GPHSGP(EGAM)}
\Rind{GPHSGP} calculates the photoelectric effect total cross-section for
a particular atom of a mixture taking into account weights. It is called by 
\Rind{GPHOT} for ${\tt Z} \leq  100$.
 
\section{Method}
 
If the energy of the radiation incident on an atom is $E_{\gamma}$, then
the quanta can be absorbed if $E_{\gamma} > E_{shell}$.
The photoelectron is emitted with total energy:
\begin{equation}
E_{photoelectron} = E_{\gamma}-E_{shell}+m_e.
\end{equation}
In the above equation it is assumed that the atom has infinite mass. One should
note that there exists a correction term (see \cite{bib-BETHE} and
references therein) which becomes more and more important with
increasing $E_{\gamma}$ \cite{bib-HALL} \cite{bib-PRATT} \cite{bib-PRATT1}.

\subsection{Probability of Interaction with an Atom}
Probability of the interaction with an atom is calculated taking into
account partial cross-sections of atoms of a mixture
or a compound.
\subsection{Probability of Interaction with a Shell}
To calculate the probability of the interaction with a particular shell we use
the jump ratios defined as:
\begin{equation}
J_{shell} = \frac{\sigma(E_{shell}+\delta E)}{\sigma(E_{shell}-\delta E)}
\label{eq:jumprat}
\end{equation}
where $\delta E \rightarrow 0$.
In addition we assume that the jump ratio is also valid away from the edges.\\
From (\ref{eq:jumprat}) it follows that the probability $p_{shell}$ 
to interact with a shell is:
\begin{equation}
p_{shell} = 1-\frac{1}{J_{shell}}
\label{eq:probrat}
\end{equation}
We use the following parametrisation of the jump ratios for $K$ and
$L_{I}$ shells\cite{bib-VEIGELE}:
\begin{equation}
J_K = \frac{125}{Z} + 3.5
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
J_{L_{I}} = 1.2
\label{eq:jumpl1}
\end{equation}
For the $L_{II}$ and $L_{III}$ shells we adopt approximation of the formulae
calculated by Gavrila \cite{bib-GAVRILA-L}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{L_{II}} &=& \gamma \beta \frac{m_e}{E_\gamma}
              \left\{
               \gamma^3-5\gamma^2+24\gamma-16
               -(\gamma^2+3\gamma-8)\frac{\log(\gamma(1+\beta))}{\gamma\beta}
              \right\}
\label{eq:sigmal2}
\end{eqnarray}
and
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{L_{III}} &=& \gamma \beta \frac{m_e}{E_\gamma}
             \left\{
                4\gamma^3-6\gamma^2+5\gamma+3
               -(\gamma^2-3\gamma+4)\frac{\log(\gamma(1+\beta))}{\gamma\beta}
             \right\}
\label{eq:sigmal3}
\end{eqnarray}
where\\
 
\begin{tabular}[t]{l@{\hspace{1cm}}p{.7\textwidth}}
$ \gamma, \beta $    & are the emitted photoelectron  Lorentz gamma and beta
                       factors;\\
$ E_\gamma      $    & is the incident radiation energy;  \\
$ m_e           $    & is the electron mass.  \\
\end{tabular}\\
Below an example of the shell interaction probability calculations for 
$E_\gamma > E_K$ is given.\\
If
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \Sigma_{II,III} & = &  \sigma_{L_{II}}+\sigma_{L_{III}} \\
   r_{L_{II}} & = & \frac{\sigma_{L_{II}}}{\Sigma_{II,III}}  \\
   r_{L_{III}} & = & \frac{\sigma_{L_{III}}}{\Sigma_{II,III}}  
\end{eqnarray*}
then from (\ref{eq:probrat}) one can find that
\begin{eqnarray*}
       p_K & = & 1-\frac{1}{J_K} \\
       p_{L_1} & = & (1-p_K)\cdot (1 - \frac{1}{J_{L_1}}) \\
       p_{L_{II}} & = & (1-p_K-p_{L_I})\cdot r_{L_{II}} \\
       p_{L_{III}} & = & (1-p_K-p_{L_I})\cdot r_{L_{III}} 
\end{eqnarray*}
After simple calculations one obtains the probability distribution function
which is used to select the shell.
\subsection{Angular distributions of photoelectrons}
 
The angular distributions of photoelectrons should be calculated using the
partial wave analysis for the outgoing electron. Since this method is very time
consuming we use approximations of the angular distributions calculated by
F. von Sauter \cite{bib-SAUTER1} \cite{bib-SAUTER2} (K shell) and Gavrila
\cite{bib-GAVRILA-K} \cite{bib-GAVRILA-L} 
(K and L shells). We use the cross-section
which is correct only to zero order in $\alpha Z$. This approximation foresees
zero scattering amplitude in the direction of incident photon while
experimentally the cross-section at $0$ angle is non-vanishing \cite{bib-NAGEL}.
If
\begin{eqnarray*}
           X &=& 1-\beta\cos\Theta
\end{eqnarray*}
then for $K$ and $L_I$ shells we use:
\begin{eqnarray}
           \frac{d\sigma_{K,L_{I}}}{d(\cos\Theta)}
           &\sim& \frac{\sin^2\Theta}{X^4}
                \left\{1+ \frac{1}{2}\gamma(\gamma-1)(\gamma-2)\right\}
\label{eq:angkl}
\end{eqnarray}
 and for $L_{II}$  and $L_{III}$ shells we have:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \frac{d\sigma_{L_{II}}}{d(\cos\Theta)}
           &\sim & \frac{(\gamma^2-1)^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\gamma^5(\gamma-1)^5}
           \left\{ \frac{\gamma(3\gamma+1)}{2 X^4}
      -\frac{\gamma^2(9\gamma^2+30\gamma-7)}{8 X^3} \right.  \nonumber \\
      \ & \ &      +\frac{\gamma^3(\gamma^3+6\gamma^2+11\gamma-2)}{4 X^2}
            -\frac{\gamma^4(\gamma-1)(\gamma+7)}{8 X} \\
         \ & \ &    +\sin^2\Theta
                  \left.    \left(
                         \frac{(\gamma+1)}{X^5}
                        -\frac{\gamma(\gamma+1)}{X^4}
                        -\frac{\gamma^2(3\gamma+1)(\gamma^2-1)}{X^3}
                      \right)
           \right\} \nonumber
\label{eq:angl2}
\end{eqnarray}
 
\begin{eqnarray}
           \frac{d\sigma_{L_{III}}}{d(\cos\Theta)}
           &\sim & \frac{(\gamma^2-1)^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\gamma^5(\gamma-1)^5}
           \left\{ -\frac{\gamma(3\gamma-1)}{2 X^4}
                   +\frac{\gamma^2(3\gamma^2-1)}{X^3} \right. \nonumber \\

                   -\frac{\gamma^4(\gamma-2)(\gamma-1)}{2 X} \\
        \ & \ & +\sin^2\Theta
                  \left.    \left(
                   \frac{(\gamma+1)}{X^5}
                  -\frac{\gamma(\gamma+1)(3\gamma-1)}{X^4}
                  +\frac{\gamma^2(\gamma^2-1)}{X^3}
                      \right)
           \right\} \nonumber
\label{eq:angl3}
\end{eqnarray}
The azimuthal angle distribution is uniform.
 
\subsection{Final State}
 
After the photoelectron emission the atom is left in excited state.
The excitation energy equal to the binding energy $E_i$ of the shell in which the interaction took place. Subsequently the atom emits a fluorescent photon
or Auger or Coster-Kronig electron. The selection of radiative or
non-radiative transition is based on compilation by Krause \cite{bib-KRAUSE}.\\
The Auger or Coster-Kronig transitions are represented by the most probable
line for a given vacancy \cite{bib-CULLEN}. The emitted electron energy $E_e$ is
\begin{equation}
 E_e = E_i-(E_j+E_k)
\label{eq:augere}
\end{equation}
where
$E_i, E_j, E_k$ are the subshell binding energies and $E_j > E_k$.\\
In case of fluorescence we use transition rates of Scofield \cite{bib-SCOFIELD}.
We use only those transitions for which the occurrence probability is not less
than 1\%. The fluorescent photon is emitted with energy $E_\gamma$
\begin{equation}
E_\gamma = E_i-E_j
\label{eq:fluore}
\end{equation}
for transition between the subshells $i$ and $j$.\\
In addition to the above, to fulfill the energy conservation law,
emission of an additional photon is simulated. For non-radiative transitions 
its energy is $E_k$ (see formula \ref{eq:augere}). In case of fluorescent
transition this photon has energy $E_j$ (see equation \ref{eq:fluore}). 
The angular distribution of the emitted particle is isotropic.

\Makehead{Photon-induced fission on heavy materials}
\section{Subroutines}
\Shubr{GPFISI}{}
\Rind{GPFISI} computes and stores in the appropriate bank (see {\tt JMATE} 
data structure) the value of the photo-fission cross sections as a 
function of the energy for all the material for which this process
is activated and with $230 \leq A \leq 240$. 
It is called during initialisation by \Rind{GPHYSI}.

\Shubr{GPFIS}{}
\Rind{GPFIS} is called by the tracking routine \Rind{GTGAMA} to generate
the final state of a photon-induced fission.

\section{Method}
 
This set of routines generates the photon-induced fission in the nuclei of
heavy materials. The code is a straight translation into the {\tt GEANT} style 
of the corresponding code from the {\tt GHEISHA} Monte Carlo program.
 
The information contained in this chapter is mainly taken from the
{\tt GHEISHA} manual to which the user is referred \cite{bib-GHEI}.
In fissionable elements the inelastic reaction of photons may be
accompanied by the fission of the nucleus. This channel is taken into account
only when the nuclear mass is between 230 and 240. The fission cross-section for
uranium is tabulated, and for other elements the parameterisation of the
A-dependence at 3 MeV neutron energy is used:
 
\[
 \sigma_f ( 3 MeV ) = - 67.0+38.7 \:  Z^{4/3 } A
\]

which implies that the fission may occur only for $ Z \geq 90$. The fission 
products are generated in an approximate way. The giant resonance effect is
included here as nuclear photoabsorbtion.
The photo-fission is activated 
by the data record \Rind{PFIS}. 
Secondaries coming from the interaction of the virtual
photon with the nucleus will be in the {\tt GEANT} temporary stack. 
If {\tt IPFIS=2} 
the secondary particles will not be generated and the
energy of the photon will be summed to {\tt DESTEP}.
A table with the photo-fission cross-sections as a function of the
energy is put in a bank at initialization time for all the materials with A
bigger than 230. See material bank structure for details.

\Makehead{Total cross-section for Rayleigh scattering}
\section{Subroutines}
\Shubr{GRAYLI}{}
 
\Rind{GRAYLI} computes the mean free path, $\lambda$, for Rayleigh
scattering as a function of the medium and of the energy. It evaluates 
also an integral of atomic form factors which is used in the routine 
\Rind{GRAYL} (see {\tt [PHYS251]}) to sample the scattering angles. 
\Rind{GRAYLI} is called during initialization by \Rind{GPHYSI}.

\section{ Method }
 
\subsection{Total cross-section}
An empirical cross-section is used to produce the total cross-section
data~\notHTML{\cite{bib-EGS3,bib-HUB1}}\HTML{\cite{bib-EGS3}, \cite{bib-HUB1}}:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_c \left( Z,E \right) = aE^3 + b E^2 + c E + d 
\mbox{ \hspace{1cm} barn/atom }
\end{equation}
The values of the coefficients are stored in the 
{\tt DATA} statement within the routine
\Rind{GRAYLI}. For each element the fit was obtained over 27 experimental
values of the total coherent cross-section. The accuracy of the
fit is estimated to be about $\Delta \sigma/\sigma \approx 10\%$, but
it is better for most of the elements.
 
\subsection{The atomic form factors}
Different empirical formulae are used to produce the atomic form factor
F(Z,E) data \cite{bib-STOR}. For $Z = 1-3, 91-99$ the empirical expression is:
\begin{equation}
F \left( Z,E \right) = a_1 E^7 + b_1 E^6 + c_1 E^5 + d_1 E^4 + e_1 E^3
+ f_1 E^2 + g_1 E + h_1
\end{equation}
for Z=100 the formula used is:
\begin{equation}
F \left( Z,E \right) = a_2 E^5 + b_2 E^4 + c_2 E^3 + d_2 E^2 + e_2 E + f_2
\end{equation}
for the other elements $F$ is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
F \left( Z,E \right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
            a_3 E^3 + b_3 E^2 + c_3 E + d_3 & \mbox{ if } E \leq E_c   \\
            a_4 E^3 + b_4 E^2 + c_4 E + d_4 & \mbox{ if } E > E_c 
                              \end{array} \right .
\end{equation}
The value of the energy $ E_c $ depends on $Z$ and it is set in the
array {\tt ELIM}. The values of the coefficients are stored in the 
{\tt DATA} statement in the routine \Rind{GRAYLI}. For each element 
the fits were performed over 97 tabulated
values of the form factors. The accuracy of the
fit is estimated to about $\Delta \sigma/\sigma = 10\%$
for $E \leq 1$ MeV for most of the elements.
The integral over the atomic form factors 
$ A \left( E_i \right)$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
A \left( E_i \right) = 2 \int_{0}^{E_i} {\left| F_T \left( E \right)
 \right|}^2 E dE = \int_{0}^{E_i}{\left| F_T \left( E \right) \right |}^2
dE^2
\end{equation}
where $ F_T \left( E \right) $ is the total atomic form factor which is
function of the energy E.

\Makehead{Simulation of Rayleigh scattering}
\Shubr{GRAYL}{}
 
\Rind{GRAYL} generates Rayleigh scattering of a photon using 
the random-number
composition and rejection technique to sample the momentum
of the scattered photon and the scattering angle, according to the
form-factor distribution. In this reaction no new particles are
generated and the kinematical quantities of the scattered photon
replace the original ones in the \FCind{/GCTRAK/} common block.
 
Activation of the Rayleigh scattering is done via the {\tt FFREAD} data
record {\tt RAYL}. If this process is activated, \Rind{GRAYL} is called
by \Rind{GTGAMA} when a Rayleigh scattering occurs.
\section{ Method }
 
The Rayleigh differential cross section as a function of $ q^2 $ is given
by \cite{bib-NELS}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \sigma_R \left( q^2 \right) }{ d \Omega } =
 \frac{ \pi r_0^2}{ k^2 } \left( \frac{1 + \mu^2 }{ 2 } \right)
 \left| F_T \left( q \right) \right| ^2
\end{equation}
where:\\
 
\[\begin{array}{LL}
r_0       & \mbox{electron radius} \\
k         & \mbox{incident wave vector} \\
q=2k sin \frac{ \theta }{2}  & \mbox{momentum of scattered
              photon ($\theta$ is the scattering angle)} \\
\mu = cos \theta  & = 1 - \frac{q^2 }{ 2 k^2} \\
F_T \left( q \right)     & \mbox{molecular form factor}
\end{array} \]
 
Under the assumption that the atoms of a molecule are completely independent,
$ \left| F_T \left( q \right) \right| ^2 $ is given by:
\begin{equation}
 \left| F_T \left( q \right) \right| ^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N}
 \frac{W_i}{A_i}  \left| F_i \left( q_i , Z_i  \right) \right| ^2
 \sigma_{c_i} \left( Z_i , E \right)
\end{equation}
where the index $i$ runs on the $N$ atoms in the molecule and:
 
\[\begin{array}{LL}
 W_i        & \mbox{proportion by weight} \\
 Z_i , A_i  & \mbox{atomic number and weight} \\
 F_i        & \mbox{form factor} \\
\sigma_{c_i}& \mbox{total atomic cross section for coherent scattering}\\
\end{array} \]
 
Using the combined composition and rejection sampling method described in
\Rind{GPAIRG} ({\tt [PHYS211]}) we may set:
\begin{equation}
f \left( q \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i f_i \left( q \right)
g_i \left( q \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} A \left( q_i^2 \right)
\frac{ \left| F_T \left( q \right) \right| ^2 }{ A \left( q_n^2 \right) }
\left( \frac{1+\mu^2}{2} \right)
\end{equation}

where:
 
\[\begin{array}{LL}
 n          & \mbox{number of energy bins} \\
 q_i        & \mbox{momentum of the photon with energy $ E_i $ of the
                 $i^{th}$  bin} \\
 q_n        & \mbox{upper limit for the momentum of the scattered photon} \\
 \alpha_i   & A \left( q_i^2 \right)  \\
 f_i \left( q \right )  &
 \frac{\left| F_T \left( q \right) \right| ^2}{A \left( q_n^2 \right)}  \\
 g_i \left( q \right )  & = \frac{1+\mu^2}{2} \mbox{\hspace{0.5cm} 
rejection function.}
\end{array} \]
 
 
Therefore, for given values of the random numbers $r_1$ and $r_2$, \Rind{GRAYL}
samples the momentum of the scattered photon and the scattering angle
$\theta$ via the following steps:
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item sample $ A \left( q^2 \right) = r_1 A \left( q_n^2 \right) $
\item find the $ \left (  q_{i-1} , q_i  \right] $ interval
which gives $ A \left( q_{i-1}^2 \right) \leq A \left( q^2 \right)
\leq  A \left( q_i^2 \right) $
\item calculate the linear extrapolation:
\begin{equation}
q = q_{i-1} + \left( A \left( q^2 \right) -  A \left( q_{i-1}^2 \right) \right)
\frac{q_i - q_{i-1} }
{ A \left( q_i^2 \right) -  A \left( q_{i-1}^2 \right)} \nonumber
\end{equation}
\item calculate $\mu = cos \theta  = 1 - q^2/(2 k^2) $
\item calculate $g_i \left( q \right) = (1 + \mu^2 )/2 $
\item if $g_i \left( q \right) > r_2 $ the event is accepted, otherwise
go back to 1.
\end{enumerate}

\Makehead{\v{C}erenkov photons}
\v{C}erenkov photons are produced when a charged particle traverses
a dielectric material.

\section{Physics processes for optical photons}
A photon is called optical when its wavelength is much greater than the
typical atomic spacing, for instance when $\lambda \geq 10nm $
which corresponds to an energy $E \leq 100eV$.
Production of an optical photon in a HEP detector is primarily due to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \v{C}erenkov effect;
\item Scintillation;
\item Fluorescence.
\end{enumerate}

Fluorescence is taken into account in {\tt GEANT} in the context of the
photoelectric effect ({\tt [PHYS230], [PHYS231]}), but only above the energy cut
{\tt CUTGAM}. Scintillation is not yet simulated by {\tt GEANT}.

Optical photons undergo three kinds of interactions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Elastic (Rayleigh) scattering;
\item Absorption;
\item Medium boundary interactions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Elastic scattering}
For optical photons elastic scattering is usually unimportant. For
$\lambda=.200\mu m$ we have $\sigma_{Rayleigh} \approx .2b$ for $N_{2}$ 
or $O_{2}$ which gives a mean free path of $\approx 1.7$ km in air
and $\approx 1$ m in quartz. 
An important exception to this is found in aerogel, which is used as a 
\v{C}erenkov radiator for some special applications. Because of the 
spectral properties of this material, Rayleigh scattering is extremely
strong and this limits its usefulness as a RICH radiator. At present,
elastic scattering of optical photons is not simulated in {\tt GEANT}.

\subsection{Absorption}
Absorption is important for optical photons because it determines the
lower $\lambda$ limit in the {\it window} of transparency
of the radiator. Absorption competes with
photo-ionisation in producing the signal in the detector, so it must be
treated properly in the tracking of optical photons.

\subsection{Medium boundary effects}
When a photon arrives at the boundary of a dielectric medium,
its behaviour depends on the nature
of the two materials which join at that boundary:
\begin{itemize}
\item Case dielectric $\rightarrow$ dielectric. \\
The photon can be transmitted (refracted ray) or reflected (reflected ray).
In case where
the photon can only be reflected, total internal reflection takes place.
\item Case dielectric $\rightarrow$ metal. \\
The photon can be absorbed by the metal or reflected back into the
dielectric. If the photon is absorbed it can be detected according to the
photoelectron efficiency of the metal.
\item Case dielectric $\rightarrow$ black material. \\
A {\it black} material is a tracking medium for which the user has not
defined any optical property. In this case the photon is immediately
absorbed undetected.
\end{itemize}

\section{Photon polarisation}
The photon polarisation is defined as a two component vector normal to the
direction of the photon:
\[
\left ( \begin{array}{c}
a_{1} e^{i \phi_{1}} \\
a_{2} e^{i \phi_{2}}
\end{array} \right ) =
e^{\phi_{o}} \left (
\begin{array}{l}
a_{1} e^{i \phi_{c}} \\
a_{2} e^{-i \phi_{c}}
\end{array} \right )
\]
where
$\phi_{c} = (\phi_{1}-\phi_{2})/2$ is called circularity and
$\phi_{o} = (\phi_{1}+\phi_{2})/2$ is called overall phase. Circularity
gives the left- or right-polarisation characteristic of the photon. RICH
materials usually do not distinguish between the two polarisations and
photons produced by the \v{C}erenkov effect are linearly polarised, that is
$\phi_{c}=0$. The circularity of the photon is ignored by {\tt GEANT}.

The overall phase is important in determining interference effects between
coherent waves. These are important only in layers of thickness comparable
with the wavelength, such as interference filters on mirrors. The effects
of such coatings can be accounted for by the empirical reflectivity factor
for the surface, and do not require a microscopic simulation.
{\tt GEANT} does not keep track of the overall phase.

Vector polarisation is described by the polarisation angle
$\tan \psi = a_{2}/a_{1}$.
Reflection/transmission probabilities are sensitive to the state of linear
polarisation, so this has to be taken into account. One parameter is
sufficient to describe vector polarisation, but to avoid too many
trigonometrical transformations, a unit vector perpendicular to the direction
of the photon is used in {\tt GEANT}.

The polarisation vectors are stored in a special track structure which
is lifted at the link {\tt LQ(JSTACK-1)} when the first \v{C}erenkov
photon is stored in the stack.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Generation of the photons}

For the formulas contained in this chapter, please see \cite{bib-JACK}.
Let $n$ be the refractive index of the dielectric material
acting as a radiator
($n=c/c'$ where $c'$ is the group velocity of light in
the material: it follows that $1 \leq n$). In a dispersive material $n$ is
an increasing function of the photon momentum $p_{\gamma},
dn/dp \geq 0$.  A particle travelling
with speed $\beta = v/c$ will emit photons at an angle  $\theta$
with respect to its direction, where $\theta$ is given by the
relation:

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\beta n}
\]

from which follows the limitation for the momentum of the
emitted photons:

\[
n(p_{\gamma}^{min}) = \frac{1}{\beta}
\]

Additionally, the photons must be within the window of transparency of
the radiator. All the photons will be contained in a cone of opening
$\cos \theta_{max}  = 1/(\beta n(p_{\gamma}^{max}))$.

The average number of photons produced is given by the relations
(Gaussian units):
\[
dN =
\frac{2 \pi z^{2}e^{2}}{\hbar c} \sin^{2} \theta \frac{d \nu}{c} dx =
\frac{2 \pi z^{2}e^{2}}{\hbar c} \left ( 1- \cos^{2} \theta
\right ) \frac{d \nu}{c} dx =
\frac{2 \pi z^{2}e^{2}}{\hbar c} \left ( 1- \frac{1}{n^{2} \beta^{2}}
\right ) \frac{d \nu}{c} dx =
\]

\[
= \frac{z^{2}e^{2}}{\hbar^{2} c^{2}} \left ( 1- \frac{1}{n^{2} \beta^{2}}
\right ) dp_{\gamma} \: dx \approx
370 z^{2} \frac{\rm photons}{\rm cm \; eV}
\left ( 1- \frac{1}{n^{2} \beta^{2}} \right ) dp_{\gamma} \: dx
\]

and

\[
\frac{dN}{dx} \approx 370 z^{2}
\int^{p_{\gamma}^{max}}_{p_{\gamma}^{min}}{dp_{\gamma}
\left ( 1- \frac{1}{n^{2} \beta^{2}} \right ) }
= 370 z^{2} \left ( p_{\gamma}^{max} -
p_{\gamma}^{min} - \frac{1}{\beta^{2}}
\int^{p_{\gamma}^{max}}_{p_{\gamma}^{min}}{dp_{\gamma}
\frac{1}{n(p_{\gamma})^{2}}} \right )
\]

The number of photons produced is calculated from a Poissonian distribution
with average value $\bar{n} = \mbox{\tt STEP} \: dN/dx$. 
The momentum distribution of
the photon is then sampled from the density function:

\[
f(p_{\gamma}) = \left ( 1- \frac{1}{n^{2}(p_{\gamma}) \beta^{2}} \right )
\]

\subsection{Tracking of the photons}

\v{C}erenkov photons are tracked in the routine \Rind{GTCKOV}. 
These particles are subject to {\it in flight} absorption (process
{\tt LABS}, number 101) and {\it boundary action} 
(process {\tt LREF}, number 102, see above). As explained
above, the status of the photon is defined by 2 vectors, the 
photon momentum ($\vec{p}=\hbar \vec{k}$) and photon polarisation 
($\vec{e}$). By convention the direction of the polarisation vector
is that of the electric field. Let also $\vec{u}$ be the normal to
the material boundary at the point of intersection, pointing 
out of the material which the photon is leaving and toward the one
which the photon is entering.
The behaviour of a photon at the surface
boundary is determined by three quantities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item refraction or reflection angle, this represents the kinematics
of the effect;
\item amplitude of the reflected and refracted waves, this is 
the dynamics of the effect;
\item probability of the photon to be refracted or reflected,
this is the quantum mechanical effect which we have to take
into account if we want to describe the photon as a particle and
not as a wave;
\end{enumerate}

As said above, we distinguish three kinds of boundary action, dielectric
$\rightarrow$ black material, dielectric $\rightarrow$ metal, dielectric
$\rightarrow$ dielectric. The first case is trivial,
in the sense that the photon is immediately absorbed and it goes
undetected. 

To determine the behaviour of the photon at the boundary,
we will at first treat it as an homogeneous monochromatic plane wave:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{E} & = & \vec{E}_{0} e^{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{x} - i \omega t} \\
\vec{B} & = & \sqrt{\mu \epsilon} \frac{\vec{k} \times \vec{E}}{k}
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsubsection{Case dielectric $\rightarrow$ dielectric}

In the classical description the incoming wave splits into a reflected
wave (quantities with a double prime) and a refracted wave (quantities
with a single prime). Our problem is solved if we find the following 
quantities:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{E'} & = & \vec{E'}_{0} e^{i \vec{k'} \cdot \vec{x} - i \omega t} \\
\vec{E''} & = & \vec{E''}_{0} e^{i \vec{k''} \cdot \vec{x} - i \omega t}
\end{eqnarray*}

For the wave numbers the following relations hold:

\begin{eqnarray*}
|\vec{k}| & = & |\vec{k}''| = k = \frac{\omega}{c} \sqrt{\mu \epsilon} \\
|\vec{k}'| & = & k' = \frac{\omega}{c} \sqrt{\mu' \epsilon'}
\end{eqnarray*}

Where the speed of the wave in the medium is $v=c/\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}$
and the quantity $n=c/v=\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}$ is called {\it refractive
index} of the medium. The condition that the three waves, refracted, reflected
and incident have the same phase at the surface of the medium, gives us the
well known Fresnel law:

\begin{eqnarray*}
(\vec{k} \cdot \vec{x})_{surf} & = & (\vec{k}' \cdot \vec{x})_{surf} =
(\vec{k}'' \cdot \vec{x})_{surf} \\
k \sin{i} & = & k' \sin{r} = k'' \sin{r'}
\end{eqnarray*}

where $i, r, r'$ are, respectively, the angle of the incident, refracted and
reflected ray with the normal to the surface. From this formula
the well known condition emerges:

\begin{eqnarray*}
i & = & r'  \\
\frac{\sin{i}}{\sin{r}} & = & \sqrt{\frac{\mu' \epsilon'}{\mu \epsilon}} =
\frac{n'}{n}
\end{eqnarray*}


The dynamic properties of the wave at the boundary are derived from Maxwell's
equations which impose the continuity of the normal components of $\vec{D}$ 
and $\vec{B}$ and of the tangential components of $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{H}$ 
at the surface boundary. The resulting ratios between the amplitudes of the
the generated waves with respect to the incoming one are 
expressed in the two following cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\item a plane wave with the electric 
field (polarisation vector) perpendicular to the plane defined by the
photon direction and the normal to the boundary:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{E_{0}'}{E_{0}} & = & \frac{2 n \cos{i}}{n \cos{i} + \frac{\mu}{\mu'}
n' \cos{r}} = 
\frac{2 n \cos{i}}{n \cos{i} + n' \cos{r}} \\
\frac{E_{0}''}{E_{0}} & = & \frac{n \cos{i} - \frac{\mu}{\mu'} n' \cos{r}}
{n \cos{i} + \frac{\mu}{\mu'} n' \cos{r}} = 
\frac{n \cos{i} - n' \cos{r}} {n \cos{i} + n' \cos{r}}
\end{eqnarray*}

where we suppose, as it is legitimate for visible or near-visible light, that
$\mu/\mu' \approx 1$;

\item a plane wave with the electric
field parallel to the above surface: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{E_{0}'}{E_{0}} & = & \frac{2 n \cos{i}}
{\frac{\mu}{\mu'} n' \cos{i} + n \cos{r}} =
\frac{2 n \cos{i}} {n' \cos{i} + n \cos{r}} \\
\frac{E_{0}''}{E_{0}} & = & \frac{\frac{\mu}{\mu'} n' \cos{i} 
- n \cos{r}}{\frac{\mu}{\mu'} n' \cos{i} + n \cos{r}} = 
\frac{n' \cos{i} - n \cos{r}}{n' \cos{i} + n \cos{r}}
\end{eqnarray*}

whith the same approximation as above.

\end{enumerate}

We note that in case of photon perpendicular to the surface, the following
relations hold:
\[
\begin{array}{LcL@{\hspace{4cm}}LcL}
\frac{E_{0}'}{E_{0}} & = & \frac{2n}{n'+n} &
\frac{E_{0}''}{E_{0}} & = & \frac{n'-n}{n'+n}
\end{array}
\]

where the sign convention for the {\it parallel} field has been adopted.
This means that if $n' > n$ there is a phase inversion for the reflected
wave.

Any incoming wave can be separated into one piece polarised parallel to the
plane and one polarised perpendicular, and the two components treated
accordingly.

To mantain the particle description of the photon, the
probability to have a
{\it refracted} (mechanism 107) or {\it reflected} 
(mechanism 106) photon must be calculated. 
The constraint is that the number of photons be conserved, and this
can be imposed via the conservation of the energy flux at the boundary,
as the number of photons is proportional to the energy. The
energy current is given by the expression:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{S} & = & \frac{1}{2} \frac{c}{4 \pi} \sqrt{\mu \epsilon} \vec{E} \times
\vec{H}^{*}
 = \frac{c}{8 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mu}} E_{0}^{2} \hat{k}
\end{eqnarray*}

and the energy balance on a unit area of the boundary requires that:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{S} \cdot \vec{u} & = & \vec{S}' \cdot \vec{u} 
- \vec{S}'' \cdot \vec{u} \\
S \cos{i} & = & S' \cos{r} + S'' \cos{i} \\
\frac{c}{8 \pi} \frac{1}{\mu} n E_{0}^{2} \cos{i} & = & 
\frac{c}{8 \pi} \frac{1}{\mu'} n' E_{0}'^{2} \cos{r} +
\frac{c}{8 \pi} \frac{1}{\mu} n E_{0}''^{2} \cos{i} 
\end{eqnarray*}

If we set again $\mu/\mu' \approx 1$, then the transmission
probability for the photon will be:

\[
T = \left( \frac{E_{0}'}{E_{0}} \right ) ^{2} 
\frac{ n' \cos{r}}{n \cos{i}}
\]

and the corresponding probability to be reflected will be $R=1-T$.

In case of reflection the relation between the incoming photon ($\vec{k},
\vec{e}$), the refracted one ($\vec{k}', \vec{e}\:'$)
and the reflected one ($\vec{k}'', \vec{e}\:''$) is given by
the following relations:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{q} & = & \vec{k} \times \vec{u} \\
e_{\parallel} & = & \frac{\vec{e} \cdot \vec{u}}{|q|} \\
e_{\perp} & = & \frac{\vec{e} \cdot \vec{q}}{|q|} \\
e_{\parallel}' & = & e_{\parallel} \frac{2 n \cos{i}} {n' \cos{i} + n \cos{r}}\\
e_{\perp}' & = & e_{\perp} \frac{2 n \cos{i}} {n \cos{i} + n' \cos{r}} \\
e_{\parallel}'' & = & \frac{n'}{n} e_{\parallel}'  - e_{\parallel} \\
e_{\perp}'' & = & e_{\perp}' - e_{\perp}
\end{eqnarray*}

After transmission or reflection of the photon, the polarisation vector
is renormalised to 1.
In the case where $\sin{r} = n \: \sin i  /n' > 1$ then there cannot
be a refracted wave, and in this case we have a total internal reflection 
according to the following formulas:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\vec{k}'' & = & \vec{k} - 2 (\vec{k} \cdot \vec{u}) \vec{u} \\
\vec{e}\:'' & = & -\vec{e} + 2 (\vec{e} \cdot \vec{u}) \vec{u}
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsubsection{Case dielectric $\rightarrow$ metal}

In this case the photon cannot be transmitted. So the probability for the
photon to be absorbed by the metal is estimated according to the table
provided by the user. If the photon is not absorbed, it is reflected.

\subsection{Surface effects}

In the case where
the surface between two bodies is perfectly polished, then the
normal provided by the program is the normal to the surface defined by
the body boundary. This is indicated by the the value {\tt POLISH}$=1$
as returned by the \Rind{GUPLSH} function. When the value returned is 
$< 1$, then a random point is generated in a sphere of radius 
$1-${\tt POLISH}, and the corresponding vector is added to the normal.
This new normal is accepted if the reflected wave is still inside the
original volume.

\section{Subroutines}

\Shubr{GSCKOV}{(ITMED, NPCKOV, PPCKOV, ABSCO, EFFIC, RINDEX)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[ITMED] ({\tt INTEGER}) tracking medium for which the optical
properties are to be defined;
\item[NPCKOV] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of bins in the tables;
\item[PPCKOV] ({\tt REAL}) array containing {\tt NPCKOV} values
of the photon momentum in GeV;
\item[ABSCO] ({\tt REAL}) array containing {\tt NPCKOV} values
of the absorption length in centimeters in case of dielectric and of the
boundary layer absorption probabilities in case of a metal;
\item[EFFIC] ({\tt REAL}) array containing {\tt NPCKOV} values of the
detection efficiency;
\item[RINDEX] ({\tt REAL}) array containing {\tt NPCKOV} values of the
refractive index for a dielectric, if {\tt RINDEX(1) = 0} the material
is a metal;
\end{DLtt}

This routine declares a tracking medium either as a radiator or as a
metal and stores the tables provided by the user. In the case of a 
metal the {\tt RINDEX} array does not need to be of length {\tt NPCKOV},
as long as it is set
to 0. The user should call this routine if he wants to use \v{C}erenkov
photons. Please note that for the moment only 
{\tt BOX}es, {\tt TUBE}s, {\tt CONE}s, {\tt SPHE}res, {\tt PCON}s,
{\tt PGON}s, {\tt TRD2}s and {\tt TRAP}s can be assigned optical properties
due to the current limitations of the \Rind{GGPERP} routine described
below.

\Shubr{GLISUR}{(X0, X1, MEDI0, MEDI1, U, PDOTU, IERR)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[X0] ({\tt REAL}) current position ({\tt X0(1)=$x$},
{\tt X0(2)=$y$}, {\tt X0(3)=$z$})
and direction ({\tt X0(4)=$p_{x}$}, {\tt X0(5)=$p_{y}$},
{\tt X0(6)=$p_{z}$})
of the photon at the boundary of a volume;
\item[X1] ({\tt REAL}) position ({\tt X1(1)=x, X1(2)=y, X1(3)=z})
beyond the boundary of the current volume,
just inside the new volume along the direction of the photon;
\item[MEDI0] ({\tt INTEGER}) index of the current tracking medium;
\item[MEDI1] ({\tt INTEGER}) index of the tracking medium into which the
photon is entering;
\item[U] ({\tt REAL}) array of three elements containing the normal to
the surface to which the photon is approaching;
\item[PDOTU] ({\tt REAL}) $-\cos \theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between
the direction of the photon and the normal to the surface;
\item[IERR] ({\tt INTEGER}) error flag, \Rind{GGPERP} could not determine
the normal to the surface if {\tt IERR} $\neq$ {\tt 0};
\end{DLtt}

This routine simulates the surface profile between two media as seen by
an approaching particle with coordinate and direction given by {\tt X0}.
The surface is identified by the arguments {\tt MEDI0} and {\tt MEDI1}
which are the tracking medium indices of the region in which the track
is presently and the one which it approaches, respectively. The input
vector {\tt X1} contains the coordinates of a point on the other side of
the boundary from {\tt X0} and lying in within medium {\tt MEDI1}. The
result is a unit vector {\tt U} normal to the surface of reflection at
{\tt X0} and pointing into the medium from which the track is approaching.

The quality of the surface finish is given by the parameter returned by
the user function \Rind{GUPLSH} (see below).

\Sfunc{GUPLSH}{VALUE = GUPLSH(MEDI0, MEDI1)}

This function must be supplied by the user. It returns a value between 0
and 1 which decsribes the quality of the surface finish between {\tt MEDI0}
and {\tt MEDI1}. The value 0 means maximum roughness with effective plane of
reflection distributed as $\cos \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is the angle
between the unit normal to the {\it effective} plane of reflection and
the normal to the nominal medium boundary at {\tt X0}. The value 1 means
perfect smoothness. In between the surface is modelled as a bell-shaped
distribution in $\alpha$ with limits given by:
\[
\sin \alpha = \pm (1-\mbox{\tt GUPLSH})
\]

At the interface between two media the routine is called to evaluate the
surface. The default version in {\tt GEANT} returns $1$, i.e. a perfectly
polished surface is assumed. When {\tt GUPLSH = 0} the distribution of the
normal to the surface is $\approx \cos \theta$.
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[MEDI0] ({\tt INTEGER}) index of the current tracking medium;
\item[MEDI1] ({\tt INTEGER}) index of the tracking medium into which the
photon is entering;
\end{DLtt}

\Shubr{GGCKOV}{}

This routine handles the generation of \v{C}erenkov photons and is called
from \Rind{GTHADR}, \Rind{GTMUON} and \Rind{GTELEC} in radiative
materials for which
the optical characteristics have been defined via the routine \Rind{GSCKOV}.

\Shubr{GSKPHO}{(IPHO)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[IPHO] ({\tt INTEGER}) number of the \v{C}erenkov photon to store
on the stack to be tracked. If {\tt IPHO = 0} all the generated photons
will be put on the stack to be tracked.
\end{DLtt}

This routines takes the \v{C}erenkov photon {\tt IPHO} generated during
the current step and stores it in the stack for subsequent tracking.
This routine performs for \v{C}erenkov photons the same function that
the \Rind{GSKING} routine performs for all the other particles. The
generated photons are stored in the common \FCind{/GCKIN2/} ({\tt 
[BASE030]}).

\Shubr{GTCKOV}{}

This routine is called to track \v{C}erenkov photons. The user routine
\Rind{GUSTEP} is called at every step of tracking. When {\tt ISTOP} = 2
the photon has been absorbed. If {\tt DESTEP} $\neq 0$ then the photon
has been detected.

\Shubr{GGPERP}{(X, U, IERR)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[X] ({\tt REAL}) array of dimension 3 containing the current position
of the track in the MARS;
\item[U] ({\tt REAL}) array of dimension 3 containing on exit the normal to
the surface of the current volume at the point {\tt X};
\item[IERR] ({\tt INTEGER}) error flag: if {\tt IERR} $\neq 0$ \Rind{GGPERP}
failed to find the normal to the surface of the current volume.
\end{DLtt}

This routine solves the general problem of calculating the unit vector
normal to the surface of the current volume at the point X. The result
is returned in the array {\tt U}. X is assumed to be outside the current
volume and near a boundary
(within {\tt EPSIL}). The current volume is indicated by the common
\FCind{/GCVOLU/}.  U points from inside to outside in that
neighbourhood. If {\tt X} is within {\tt EPSIL} of more than one boundary
(i.e. in a corner) an arbitrary choice is made.
If {\tt X} is inside the current volume
or if the current volume is not handled by the routine,
the routine returns with
{\tt IERR=1}, otherwise {\tt IERR=0}. At the moment the routine only
handles {\tt BOX}es, {\tt TUBE}s, {\tt SPHE}res and {\tt CONE}s.

\section{Processes involving \v{C}erenkov photons}

The process of generating a \v{C}erenkov photon is called {\tt CKOV}
and corresponds to the process value 105 (variable {\tt LMEC} in
common \FCind{/GCTRAK/}).
This process is activated only in a radiator defined via the routine
\Rind{GSCKOV}.

The process of photon absorption (name {\tt LABS}, code 101) is controlled
by the {\tt LABS} {\tt FFREAD} data record. By default the process is
activated for all the materials for which optical properties have been
defined.

The action taken at the boundary is identified by the process name {\tt LREF},
code 102.

At a boundary a photon can be either reflected (name {\tt REFL}, code 106)
or refracted (name {\tt REFR}, code 107).

\Shubr{GMGAUS}{(BETA2,DIN*)}

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMMMM}
\item[BETA2] ({\tt REAL}) $\beta^2$;
\item[DIN]  ({\tt REAL}) array of 3 containing the 
direction of the scattered particle with respect to the
incoming direction.
\end{DLtt}
This routine is called by \Rind{GTELEC}, \Rind{GTHADR},
\Rind{GTMUON} and \Rind{GTHION} via
\Rind{GMULTS} when the variable {\tt IMULS},
controlled by the data record {\tt MULS} is equal to 3.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Approximations in use}
 
A charged particle traversing a medium is deflected by many
scatters, mostly at small angle. These scatters are due to
the interaction with the Coulomb field of the nuclei, and
to a lesser degree, to the electron field, hence the name
of Coulomb scattering. For hadronic projectiles, however,
the strong interaction contributes to multiple scattering.
Multiple scattering is well described by Moli\`{e}re
theory~\cite{bib-BET1}.
Moli\`{e}re multiple scattering theory is used by default
in {\tt GEANT} (see {\tt [PHYS325]}). 
We define $\theta_0 = \theta^{rms}_{plane} = 
\theta^{rms}_{space}/\sqrt{2}$ as the r.m.s. of the angle between the
directions projected on a plane 
of a particle before and after traversing a thickness $t$
of absorber. In this case a simple form for the multiple Coulomb
scattering of singly charged particles which is widely used is:
\[
\theta_0 \approx \frac{15 MeV}{E \beta^2} \sqrt{\frac{t}{X_0}}
\]

where $X_0$ is the radiation length of the absorber. This form was
proposed by~\cite{bib-ROS1}, \cite{bib-ROS2}. It can
introduce large errors because it ignores significant dependences from
pathlength and $Z$. To compensate for this, a similar formula was
proposed~\cite{bib-HIG1}, \cite{bib-HIG2}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys320-1}
\theta_0 \approx \frac{14.1 MeV}{E \beta^2} \sqrt{\frac{t}{X_0}}
\left [ 1 + 0.038 \log \left( \frac{t}{X_0} \right ) \right ]
\end{equation}

A form taking into account the $\beta$ and $z$ dependence of
the particle has been proposed by~\cite{bib-LINC}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys320-2}
\theta_0 = \frac{S_{2}}{E \beta^2} \sqrt{\frac{t}{X_0}}
\left [ 1 + \epsilon \log_{10} \left( \frac{t Z_{inc}^2}{X_0 \beta^2} 
\right ) \right ]
\end{equation}

The problem with the formulae (\ref{eq:phys320-1}) and (\ref{eq:phys320-2})
is that if the distance $t$ in the absorber is travelled in two steps
$t = t_1 + t_2$, the r.m.s. angle $\theta_0(t) = \theta_0(t_1 +
t_2) \neq \sqrt{\theta_0^2(t_1) + \theta_0^2(t_2)}$, limiting their use
in a MonteCarlo like {\tt GEANT}.

Much of the difficulty in approximating multiple Coulomb scattering
in terms of the radiation length is that the number of radiation
lengths is a poor measure of the scattering. A better expression,
which is used in {\tt GEANT} has been proposed by \cite{bib-LINC}:

\begin{equation}
\theta_0^2 = \frac{\chi_c^2}{1+F^2} \left [
\frac{1+\nu}{\nu} \log( 1+\nu) -1 \right ]
\end{equation}

where

\begin{eqnarray*}
\nu & = & \frac{\Omega_0}{2 ( 1-F)} \\
F & = & \mbox{fraction of the tracks in the sample} \\
\Omega_0 & = & \frac{\chi_c^2}{1.167 \chi_{\alpha}^2} \mbox{\hspace{0.5cm}
is the mean number of scatters}
\end{eqnarray*}

$\chi_c^2$ and $\chi_{\alpha}^2$ are parameters of the Moli\`{e}re
theory, for which the reader is invited to see {\tt [PHYS325]},
and $1.167 \approx \exp(2\gamma -1)$ where $\gamma$ is the Euler's
constant $= 0.57721 \dots$. This form, which is the result of empirical
fits, is derived from the screened Rutherford cross section, which has
the form $2\chi_{\alpha}^2/(\chi_{\alpha}^2+\theta_0^2)$. For $F$ anywhere
from $0.9$ to $0.995$ this expression represents Moli\`{e}re scattering
to better than $2\%$ for $10 < \Omega_0 < 10^{8} $, which covers
singly charged relativistic particles ($\beta \approx 1$) in the
range $10^{-3} < t/X_0 < 100$.

In {\tt GEANT} we have adopted the values of $F=0.98$ and $\Omega_0 = 40,000$
scatters, obtaining the following formula:

\[
\theta_0 = 2.557 \chi_{cc} \frac{\sqrt{t}}{E \beta^2}
\]

where $\chi_{cc}$ is another parameter of the Moli\`{e}re theory
for which the reader is referred to {\tt [PHYS325]}. This algorithm
is implemented by the routine \Rind{GMGAUS}.

\section{Subroutines}
\subsection{Initialisation}

\Shubr{GMULOF}{}
\Rind{GMULOF} calculates the table of maximum
steps corresponding to the
energies in the array {\tt ELOW} for electrons and muons.
It is called during initialisation by \Rind{GPHYSI}.
For hadrons and ions the computation is performed during 
tracking in the routines \Rind{GTHADR} and \Rind{GTHION}.

\Shubr{GMOLI}{(AC,ZC,WMAT,NLM,DENS,OMC*,CHC*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[AC] {\tt REAL} array of dimenstion {\tt NLM} containing
the mass numbers;
\item[ZC] {\tt REAL} array  of dimenstion {\tt NLM} 
containing the atomic numbers;
\item[WMAT] {\tt REAL} array containing the proportions by
weight of the component of a mixture/compound. {\tt 1} in case
of a single component;
\item[NLM] {\tt INTEGER} number of the elements in the mixture/compound;
\item[DENS] {\tt REAL} density in g cm$^{-3}$;
\item[OMC] {\tt REAL} $b_{c}$ constant of Moli\`{e}re theory;
\item[CHC] {\tt REAL} $\chi_{cc}$ constant of Moli\`{e}re theory.
\end{DLtt}

\Rind{GMOLI} calculates the two material-dependent constants 
({\tt OMC} and {\tt CHC}). These are 
needed during initialisation by \Rind{GMULOF} and during tracking
to sample the scattering angle, as explained below.
It is called at initialisation time by the routine
\Rind{GPROBI} which initialises some material constants and computes
the probabilities for various processes.

\subsection{Sampling of the multiple scattering angle}

\Shubr{GMULTS}{}
\Rind{GMULTS} is the steering routine for the sampling
of the multiple scattering angle when the variable {\tt IMULTS}
in common \FCind{/GCPHYS/} is {\tt 1} or {\tt 2}. This variable
can be controlled by the {\tt MULT} data record.
The routine decides if the material-dependent constant {\tt OMC}
computed by \Rind{GMOLI} during initialisation has to

\section{Method} 
\subsection{Introduction}
When traversing ordinary matter, elementary particles undergo deflection
from their originary trajectory due to the interaction with the atoms.
This effect is rather large for charged particles, which are deflected
by the electric field of nuclei and electrons via a large number of 
small elastic {\it collisions}. To simulate precisely the transport of
particles in matter, it is important to provide a precise description 
of this effect. Considerable effort has gone over the years into
the formulation of a theory of Coulomb multiple scattering. In 
{\tt GEANT} we follow the theory originally formulated by Moli\`{e}re
\cite{bib-MOLI} \cite{bib-MOL1} and then elaborated by Bethe 
\cite{bib-BET1}. A review of this theory can be found in \cite{bib-SCOT}.

It should be noted that this is not the only theory which describes
multiple Coulomb scattering, and a thorough analysis of the problem has
been performed by Goudsmit and Saunderson \cite{bib-GOUD} \cite{bib-GOU1}.

A complete account of the Moli\`{e}re theory is outside the scope of this
manual. For more information the interested reader could refer to the
works cited above and to the EGS4 manual
\cite{bib-EGS4}, from which the notation used in the present chapter
has been derived. 

The principal limitations of Moli\`{e}re theory are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the angular deflection is {\it small}. Effectively this
constraint provides the upper limit for the step-size;
\item the theory is a {\it multiple scattering} theory; that is, many
atomic collisions participate in causing the incident particle to be
deflected. In some implementations, this constraints provides a lower 
limit on the step size. In {\tt GEANT}, when the number of scatters is
below the limit of applicability of Moli\`{e}re single Coulomb scatterings
are simulated, so that there is no effective minimum step size below which
multiple scattering is {\it switched off};
\item the theory applies only in semi-infinite homogeneous media. This 
constraint calls for a very careful handling of particles near to a
medium's boundary;
\item there is no energy loss built into the theory. This again introduces
the necessity to take small steps;
\end{enumerate}

In Moli\`{e}re theory corrected for finite angle
scattering ($\sin\theta \neq \theta$) as described by 
Bethe~\notHTML{\cite{bib-BET1,bib-SCOT}}\HTML{\cite{bib-BET1} 
\cite{bib-SCOT}},
the angular distribution is given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
      f(\theta) \: \theta d\theta & = & \sqrt{\frac{\sin\theta}{\theta}} \:
f_r(\eta) \: \eta d\eta,
\end{eqnarray}
 
where for $f_r(\eta)$ we use the first three terms of Bethe's expansion:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:phys325-1}
f_r(\eta) & = & f_{r}^{(0)}(\eta)+
f_{r}^{(1)}(\eta)B^{-1}+f_{r}^{(2)}(\eta)B^{-2} \\
\eta & = & \frac{\theta}{\chi_c \sqrt{ B }} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
$\eta$ is called the {\it reduced angle}.

\subsection{Calculation of the reduced angle}
In formula (\ref{eq:phys325-1}) above $\chi_c$ the {\it critical
scattering angle} defined as:
\begin{equation}
\chi^2_c = \frac{4 \pi e^4  Z_s \rho N_{Av} Z_{inc}^2 t}{W c^2 p^2\beta^2} 
= \chi^2_{cc} Z_{inc}^2 \frac{t}{E^2\beta^4}
\end{equation}
with
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
Z_{inc} & \mbox{incident particle charge}               \\
Z_{s}   & \mbox{defined below}                           \\
N_{Av}  & \mbox{Avogadro's number}                      \\
\rho  & \mbox{density}                                  \\
W     & \sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i A_i \mbox{\hspace{0.5cm}molecular weight}  \\
E     & \mbox{particle energy in $MeV$}                    \\
r_0   & e^2/(m c^2) \mbox{\hspace{0.5cm} classical electron radius} \\
t     & \mbox{total path length in the scatterer (and not its thickness).}
\end{array}
\]

The variable $\chi_c$ is factorised into two parts.
The first part, $\chi_{cc}$, is a constant of the medium for 
a given incident particle.
The second part depends on the incident particle energy and on the
path length in the medium. 

\begin{equation}
\chi^2_{cc} = \frac{4 \pi e^{4} Z_s \rho N_{Av}}{W} = \frac{4 \pi c^4 r_0^2
m_e^2 Z_s \rho N_{Av}}{W} \approx (0.39612 \: 10^{-3})^2
Z_s \frac{\rho}{W}
\left [ \: GeV^2 \: cm^{-1} \right ] 
\end{equation}

The variable {\tt CHC} or {\tt CHCMOL} stored in {\tt Q(JPROB+25)} corresponds
to $\chi_{cc}$. 
$B$ is defined by the equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys325-2}
B-\ln B =\ln\Omega_0, 
\end{equation}

where $\Omega_0$ can be interpreted as the number of collisions in the step:

\begin{equation}
\Omega_0 =\frac{ \chi^2 _c}{e^{2\gamma-1}\chi_\alpha^2} 
= b_c Z_{inc}^2\frac{t}{\beta^2}
\end{equation}

Here $\gamma$ is Euler's constant ($\gamma =0.57721\dots$)
and $\chi_\alpha$ the atomic electron
screening angle. For a single element this is given by:

\[
\chi_\alpha^2 = \left ( \frac{\lambda_0}{2 \pi r_{TF}} \right ) ^2
\left [ 1.13 + 3.76 \left ( \frac{\alpha Z Z_{inc}}{\beta} \right ) ^2 \right ]
\]

where

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\lambda_0}{2 \pi} & = & \hbar/p 
\mbox{\hspace{0.5cm}Compton wavelength of the electron} \\
r_{TF} & = & 0.885 a_0 Z^{-\frac{1}{3}} \mbox{\hspace{0.5cm}Thomas-Fermi
radius of the atom} \\
a_0 & = & \frac{\hbar^2}{m e^2} \mbox{\hspace{0.5cm}Bohr's radius} \\
\alpha & = & 1/137.035 \dots \mbox{\hspace{0.5cm}the fine-structure constant}
\end{eqnarray*}

so that we have

\[
\chi_\alpha^2 = \frac{m^2 e^4 1.13}{p^2 \hbar^2 (0.885)^2} Z^{\frac{2}{3}}
\left [ 1 + 3.34 \left ( \frac{\alpha Z Z_{inc}}{\beta} \right ) ^2 \right ].
\]

For a compound/mixture the following rule holds:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\ln(\chi_\alpha^2) & = & \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N n_i Z_i (Z_i+1) \ln
( \chi_{\alpha i}^2)}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N n_i Z_i (Z_i+1)} = 
\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i (Z_i+1) \ln
( \chi_{\alpha i}^2) }{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i (Z_i+1)}\\
& = & \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i (Z_i+1) \ln \left \{
\frac{m^2 e^4 1.13}{p^2 \hbar^2 (0.885)^2} Z_i^{\frac{2}{3}}
\left [ 1 + 3.34 \left ( \frac{\alpha Z_i Z_{inc}}{\beta} \right ) ^2 \right ]
\right \} }{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i (Z_i+1)} \\
& = & \ln \left ( \frac{m^2 e^4 1.13}{p^2 \hbar^2 (0.885)^2} \right ) -
\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i (Z_i+1) \ln 
Z_i^{-\frac{2}{3}}}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i (Z_i+1)} \\
 & & + \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i (Z_i+1) 
\left [ 1 + 3.34 \left ( \frac{\alpha Z_i Z_{inc}}{\beta} \right ) ^2 \right ]}
{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i (Z_i+1)} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

To understand the transformations in the above formulae, the following 
should be noted. Let $n_i$ be the number of atoms
of type $i$ in a compound/mixture, that is the number of moles
of element $i$ in a mole of material, and $p_i$ the proportion by weight
of that element. We have the following relation:

\[
p_i = \frac{n_i A_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} n_j A_j} \mbox{\hspace{2cm} that
is\hspace{2cm}} n_i = \left ( \sum_{j=1}^{N} n_j A_j \right ) 
\frac{p_i}{A_i} = W  \frac{p_i}{A_i}
\]

so that we can simplify expressions in the following way:

\[
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i \dots}{W} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (p_i/A_i) \dots
\]

If now we set

\[
\begin{array}{L@{}c@{}L@{}c@{}L@{}c@{}L}
Z_s & = & \sum^{N}_{i = 1} n_i Z_i(Z_i+1)  & =  &
W \sum^{N}_{i = 1} \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i(Z_i+1) & = & W Z_s'  \\
Z_E & = & \sum^{N}_{i = 1} n_i Z_i(Z_i + 1 )\ln Z_i^{-2/3}  & = &
W\sum \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i(Z_i + 1 )\ln Z_i^{-2/3} & = & W Z_E' \\
Z_x & = & \sum^{N}_{i = 1} n_i Z_i(Z_i + 1 ) \ln \left [ 1+3.34
\left( \frac{\alpha Z_i Z_{inc}}{\beta}\right)^2 \right ] \\
 & = & W \sum^{N}_{i = 1} \frac{p_i}{A_i} Z_i(Z_i + 1 ) \ln \left [ 1+3.34
\left( \frac{\alpha Z_i Z_{inc}}{\beta}\right)^2 \right ] & &  & = & W Z_x'
\end{array}
\]

we can write:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\ln(\chi_{\alpha}^2) & = & 
\ln \left ( \frac{m^2 e^4 1.13}{p^2 \hbar^2 (0.885)^2} \right )
+ \frac{Z_x-Z_E}{Z_s} \\
\chi_{\alpha}^2 & = & \frac{m^2 e^4 1.13}{p^2 \hbar^2 (0.885)^2} 
e^{(Z_x  - Z_E )/Z_s} = \frac{m^2 e^4 1.13}{p^2 \hbar^2 (0.885)^2}
e^{(Z_x'  - Z_E' )/Z_s'}
\end{eqnarray*}

and finally:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Omega_0 & = & \frac{ \chi^2 _c}{e^{2\gamma-1}\chi_\alpha^2} \\
 & = & \frac{1}{1.167} \:
\frac{4 \pi e^4  Z_s \rho N_{Av} Z_{inc}^2 t}{W c^2 p^2\beta^2} \:
\frac{p^2 \hbar^2 (0.885)^2}{1.13 m^2 e^4}e^{-(Z_x'  - Z_E' )/Z_s'} \\
 & = & b_c Z_{inc}^2\frac{t}{\beta^2} \\
b_c & = & \frac{4 \pi N_{Av} \hbar^2}{m^2 c^2}
\frac{(0.885)^2}{1.13 \times 
1.167} \rho Z_s' e^{(Z_E'  - Z_x' )/Z_s'} \approx 6702.33 \rho Z_s'
e^{(Z_E'  - Z_x' )/Z_s'}
\end{eqnarray*}

The quantity $b_c$ is calculated during initialisation by
the routine \Rind{GMOLI} setting $\beta=1$ and $Z_{inc}=1$. 
This variable is called
{\tt OMC} or {\tt OMCMOL} and it is stored in {\tt Q(JPROB+21)}.
It has, via the atomic electron screening angle $\chi_{\alpha}^2$,
a small dependence
on $\beta$  and $Z_{inc}$ in the term $Z_x$. The quantity $b_c \rho Z_s'$
is re-evaluated during tracking by the routine \Rind{GMOLIO}, called by
\Rind{GMULTS}, only when necessary.

The dependence of $Z_x$ on $\beta$ and $Z_{inc}$ is via a term of the form:
$1+3.34\left(\alpha Z Z_{inc}\beta^{-1} \right )^2$, so it is not 
necessary to recalculate it as long as
$1 + 3.34\left(\alpha Z Z_{inc}\beta^{-1} \right )^2 \approx
1 + 3.34\left(\alpha Z \right )^2$ that is:

\[
\begin{array}{RcLcLcL}
3.34 (Z \alpha)^2  \left [ \left( \frac{Z_{inc}}{\beta} \right )^2
-1 \right] & \ll & 1 & \Rightarrow &
Z^2 \frac{Z_{inc}^2 - \beta^2}{\beta^2} & \ll & 3.34 \alpha^{-2} 
\approx 5500 \\ [.2cm]
 Z^2 ( Z_{inc}^2 - \beta^2 ) & \leq & 50 \beta^2
\end{array}
\]

For mixtures/compounds this condition should be checked for every component
and this would be unacceptable from the point of view of computer time. So
we simply make the condition more restrictive multiplying the first term
by the number of elements in the mixture/compound.

\subsection{Sampling of the distribution function}

The component distribution functions (\ref{eq:phys325-1}) are given by
 
\[
\begin{array}{lcccr}
f_{r}^{(0)}(\eta)   & = & 2e^{-\eta^2}  & = &  2D_0(1,1,-\eta^2)         \\
f_{r}^{(1)}(\eta)   &   &               & = &  2D_1(2,1,-\eta^2)         \\
f_{r}^{(2)}(\eta)   &   &               & = &   D_2(3,1,-\eta^2),
\end{array}
\]
 
where $ D_n(a,b,z) = d^n[\Gamma(a)M(a,b,z)]/d a^n $, with
$M(a,b,z)$ the Kummers hypergeometric function.
 
Integrals of the functions $f_{r}^{(1)}$ and $f_{r}^{(2)}$ needed for the
Monte Carlo can be written down directly in terms of the $D$ functions
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{\eta}^{\infty}\eta f_{r}^{(1)} \: \eta  d\eta & = &
     D_1 ( 2,1, - \eta^2)-D_1( 1,1, - \eta^2 ) - D_0 ( 1,1,-\eta^2)\\
\int_{\eta}^{\infty}\eta f_{r}^{(2)} \: \eta d\eta    & = &
\frac{1}{2} D_2 (3,1,-\eta^2) - D_2 (2,1,-\eta^2) - D_1(2,1,-\eta^2)
\end{eqnarray*}
 
We note that the first term is just the Gaussian part and it dominates
for large $B$, that is, for large number of scatters, as it has to
be expected. Recalling the definition of $\eta$ in (\ref{eq:phys325-1})
we can say that the half-width of the Gaussian part of the Moli\`{e}re
distribution is $\sigma^{2} = \chi_{c}^2 B/2$.
Routine \Rind{GMOLIE} performs the sampling of the Moli\`{e}re 
distribution via the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the value of $B$ is calculated recursively. If we set $f(B) = 
B$ with $f(B) = \ln \Omega_0  + \ln B$ the relation used is
$B_n = B_{n-1} + \Delta B = B_{n-1} + (f(B_{n-1}) - B_{n-1})/
(1-1/B_{n-1})$. Convergence is assumed when $|\Delta B| \leq 10^{-4}$.

\item a random number $r_1$ is sampled and
a table of four values $F_{r}(\eta_i)$ is built with
$i = j-2,j-1,j,j+1$ and $F_{r}(\eta_j) \geq r_1$. $F$ is the distribution
function derived from (\ref{eq:phys325-1}):
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{r}(\eta) & = & \int_{0}^{\eta}{f_{r}(t) \: dt}
= \int_{0}^{\eta}{f_{r}^{(0)}(t)+f_{r}^{(1)}(t)B^{-1}+f_{r}^{(2)}(t)B^{-2} \: dt} \\
& = & \int_{0}^{\eta}{f_{r}^{(0)}(t) \: dt} + 
B^{-1} \int_{0}^{\eta}{f_{r}^{(1)}(t) \: dt} +
B^{-2} \int_{0}^{\eta}{f_{r}^{(2)}(t) \: dt} \\
& = & F_{r}^{(0)}(\eta) +
B^{-1} F_{r}^{(1)}(\eta) + B^{-2} F_{r}^{(2)}(\eta)
\end{eqnarray*}

40 values of the functions $F_{r}^{(n)}$ are tabulated.

\item using a four-points continued-fraction interpolation method 
(\Rind{GMOL4}) a table of $\eta_i^2$ is interpolated using
the values of $r_1$ and $F$ tabulated in the previous step. 
This is similar
to the inversion of the distribution function, but instead of
obtaining directly the random variable, we interpolate a table
of its squares.
This provides a better fit to the inverse function;

\item the value of $\theta = \chi_{c} \sqrt{B \eta^2}$ is calculated;

\item a random number $r_2$ is extracted, and the rejection function
$g(\theta) = \sqrt{\sin\theta/\theta}$ is computed. If $r_2 > g(\theta)$
resampling begins from step 2, otherwise the value is accepted.
\end{enumerate}

The Moli\`ere distribution gives the space scattering angle. A similar
expression may be written for the lateral displacement of the
scattered particles. However, the problem of joint angle lateral displacement
in the Moli\`ere approximation has not been solved, and,  for small
step size, lateral displacement is of second order and may be neglected.
This introduces a problem when large step sizes are taken. The step
size can be artificially limited via the use of the variable {\tt
STEMAX}, which is an argument to the routine \Rind{GSTMED}. For more
information on this point the user is invited to consult chapter
{\tt [CONS200]}.

\section{Path and step length}
\subsection{Restrictions on the step length}
Restrictions on the length of the step arise from:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the number of scatters
$\Omega_0 \geq 20 $ to stay within the multiple scattering regime. When
$\Omega_0 < 20$, an appropriate number of {\it single} scatterings is
used. See routine \Rind{GMCOUL} {\tt [PHYS328]}.
\item
$\chi_c^2B \leq 1 $ i.e. the width of the Gaussian part of the distribution
should be less than one radian. This
condition induces a maximum step length for the multiple scattering called
$t_{Bethe}$. In order to find this value we write the limiting condition
as $\chi_c^2(t_{Bethe})B(t_{Bethe}) = 1 $, that is 
$B(t_{Bethe}) = 1/\chi_c^2(t_{Bethe})$. Now using equation 
(\ref{eq:phys325-2}) we take the exponential of both members 
$B(t_{Bethe}) \Omega_0(t_{Bethe}) = \exp(1/\chi_c^2(t_{Bethe}))$. 
Dividing the two last equalities we obtain:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Omega_0(t_{Bethe}) = \frac{b_c Z_{inc}^2}{\beta^2} t_{Bethe} & = & 
\chi_c^2 (t_{Bethe})\exp(1/\chi_c^2(t_{Bethe})) \\
&  = & \frac{\chi_{cc}^2 Z_{inc}^2 t_{Bethe} 
\exp{[(E^2\beta^4)/(\chi_{cc}^2 Z_{inc}^2 t_{Bethe})]}}
{E^2\beta^4} \\
\exp{[(E^2\beta^4)/(\chi_{cc}^2 Z_{inc}^2 t_{Bethe})]} & = & 
\frac{b_c E^2 \beta^2}{\chi_{cc}^2} \\
t_{Bethe} & = & \frac{E^2 \beta^4}{\chi_{cc}^2 \: Z_{inc}^2 \: \ln
\left [b_c E^2 \beta^2/\chi_{cc}^2 \right]}
\end{eqnarray*}
 
For electrons and muons this constraint on the step-length is tabulated
at initialisation time in the routine \Rind{GMULOF} {\tt [PHYS201]}.
For hadrons this formula can be approximated as:
\[
t_{Gauss}
\approx \left(\frac{1}{14.1 \: 10^{-3}} \: \frac{E^2 \beta}{Z_{inc}}
\right )^2 X_0,
\]
where $E$ is in GeV and $X_0$ is the radiation length in centimeters and
the formula has been taken from the Gaussian approximation to multiple
scattering (see {\tt [PHYS320]}). This condition is more restrictive, 
because it is equivalent to require that the width of the Gaussian
part of the distribution be less than $0.5$, but it has been found that
the two conditions are numerically equivalent;
\item limitation due to the path length correction algorithm used (see
below).
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Path Length Correction}
 
A path length correction may be applied in an approximate manner.
We have from the Fermi-Eyges theory \cite{bib-EGS4}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys325-3}
t = S + \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{t}{\bar{\theta}^{2}\bar{(t)} \: dt}
\end{equation}
where
\[
\begin{array}{LL}
\bar{\theta}^2\bar{(t)}  & \mbox{the mean square angle of scattering;} \\
S                     & \mbox{step size along a straight line;} \\
t                      & \mbox{actual path length.}
\end{array}
\]
 
We have further:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys325-4}
\bar{\theta}^2\bar{(t)} = \left( 0.0212 \frac{Z_{inc}}{p\beta} \right)^2
\frac{t}{X_0}
\end{equation}
$X_0$ is the radiation length. From (\ref{eq:phys325-3}) and 
(\ref{eq:phys325-4}) we get
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys325-5}
S = t - K t^2
\makebox[4cm]{with}
K = 1.12 \times 10^{-4} \: \frac{Z_{inc}^2}{p^2\beta^2X_0}
\end{equation}
Equation (\ref{eq:phys325-5}) 
may be used to make the path length correction. Solving equation
(\ref{eq:phys325-5}) with respect to $t$ implies that, in order to
obtain real solutions:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys325-6}
S \leq \frac{1}{4K} \makebox[3cm]{i.e.} S \leq 2232 \:
\frac{X_0 p^2 \beta^2}{Z_{inc}^2}
\end{equation}
This condition provides an additional constraint to the maximum step
length for multiple scattering (variable {\tt TMXCOR} in routine \Rind{GMULOF}).
The corrected step can be approximated as:
\[
t \approx S(1 + KS) = S ( 1 + \mbox{\tt CORR} )
\]
where {\tt CORR} $ \leq 0.25$ due to condition (\ref{eq:phys325-6}).

\Shubr{GMCOUL}{(OMEGA,DIN*)}
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMM}
\item[OMEGA] ({\tt REAL}) $\Omega_0$ of the Moli\`ere theory;
\item[DIN]  ({\tt REAL}) array of dimension 3 containing the
direction of the scattered particle with respect to the
incoming direction;
\end{DLtt}
Generates single scatters in small angle approximation returning
the new direction with respect to the old one.
It is called by \Rind{GMULTS} when $\Omega_0 \leq 20$.

\section{Method} 

In the Moli\`{e}re theory the average number of Coulomb scatters 
for a charged particle in a step is 
expressed by the parameter $\Omega_0$ (see {\tt [PHYS325]}).
When 
$\Omega_0 \leq 20$, the Moli\`{e}re theory is not applicable any
more, even if it has been noted \cite{bib-THEO} that it still gives reasonable
results down to its {\it mathematical limit} $\Omega_0 = e$.
The range $1<\Omega_0 \leq 20$ is called the {\it plural
scattering} regime.
An interesting study of this regime can be found in \cite{bib-KEIL}.

In {\tt GEANT}, when $\Omega_0 \leq 20$, a direct simulation method
is used for the scattering angle. 
The number of scatters is distributed according to a Poissonian law
with average $\Omega = k \Omega_0 = e^{2\gamma-1} \Omega_0 
\approx 1.167 \Omega_0$ with $\gamma = 0.57721\dots$ Euler's constant.
Using the customary notations for
the probability distribution function for small
angle ($\sin \theta \approx \theta$) single scattering, we
can write:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys328-1}
f(\theta) \theta d\theta = \frac{d \sigma}{\theta d\theta} \frac{1}
{\sigma} \theta d\theta
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ is the cross section for single elastic scattering.
We use as cross section the one reported by Moli\`{e}re \cite{bib-MOLI}
\cite{bib-MOL1}:

\[
\frac{d \sigma}{\theta d\theta} = 2 \pi \left ( \frac{2 Z Z_{inc}
e^2}{p v} \right ) ^2 \frac{1}{(\theta^2 + \chi_{\alpha}^2)^2}
\]

This is the classical Rutherford cross section corrected by the
screening angle $\chi_{\alpha}$. This angle is described by Moli\`{e}re
as a correction to the Born approximation used to derive the
quantum mechanical form of the Rutherford cross section. We have then:

\[
\sigma = \int_{0}^{\infty}{\frac{d \sigma}{\theta d\theta} \theta d\theta}
= 2 \pi \left ( \frac{2 Z Z_{inc}e^2}{p v} \right ) ^2
\int_{0}^{\infty}{\frac{\theta d \theta}{(\theta^2 + \chi_{\alpha}^2)^2}} =
\pi \left ( \frac{2 Z Z_{inc}e^2}{p v} \right ) ^2 
\frac{1}{\chi_{\alpha}^2}
\]

and so equation (\ref{eq:phys328-1}) becomes:

\[
f(\theta) \theta d\theta = \chi_{\alpha}^2 \frac{2 \theta d \theta}
{(\theta^2 + \chi_{\alpha}^2)^2} = \frac{ 2 \Theta d \Theta}{(1+\Theta^2)^2}
\]

where we have set $\Theta = \theta / \chi_{\alpha}$. To sample from this
distribution we calculate the inverse of the distribution function:

\[
\eta = \int_{0}^{\Theta}{\frac{2 t d t}{(1+t^2)^2}} 
 =  1 - \frac{1}{1+\Theta^2} \hspace{1cm} \Rightarrow \hspace{1cm}
\Theta = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1-\eta}-1}
\]

where $\eta$ is a number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. If we
observe that also $1-\eta$ is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 and
we remember the definition of $\Theta$, we obtain:

\[
\theta = \sqrt{\chi_{\alpha}^2 \left (\frac{1}{\eta}-1 \right)}
\]

To calculate $\chi_{\alpha}^2$ we observe that:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Omega_0 & = & \frac{\chi_{c}^2}{k \chi_{\alpha}^2} \\
\chi_{\alpha}^2 & = & \frac{\chi_{c}^2}{k \Omega_0} =
\frac{\chi_{cc}^2 Z_{inc}^2 t/E^2\beta^4}{k b_{c} Z_{inc}^2 t /\beta^2} =
\frac{\chi_{cc}^2}{k b_{c} p^2 c^2}
\end{eqnarray*}

where we have used the notations of {\tt [PHYS325]} and 
$k = 1.167$.

\section{Subroutines}
\Shubr{GDRELA}{}
\Rind{GDRELA} initialises the ionisation energy loss tables for different
materials for muons, electrons and positrons and other particles.
The energy binning is set within the array
{\tt ELOW} (common \FCind{/GCMULO/}) in the routine \Rind{GPHYSI}.
The tables are filled with the quantity $dE/dx$ in GeV/cm (formula 
(\ref{eq:phys330-3}) below)
which is valid for an element as well as a mixture or a compound.
In the tables the dE/dx due to ionisation is summed with the
energy loss coming from bremsstrahlung.
For energy loss of electrons and positrons, it calls \Rind{GDRELE}
using the following pointers:

\begin{tabular}{llr}
 \mbox{\tt JMA = LQ(JMATE-I)} &  pointer to the I$^{th}$ material \\
 \mbox{\tt JEL1 = LQ(JMA-1) } &  pointer for dE/dx for electrons  \\
 \mbox{\tt JEL1+90          } &  pointer for dE/dx for positron \\
\end{tabular}

\Rind{GDRELA} is called at initialisation time by \Rind{GPHYSI}.
\Shubr{GDRELE}{(EEL,CHARGE,JMA,DEDX)}
\Rind{GDRELE} computes the ionisation energy loss ({\tt DEDX}) for electrons 
({\tt CHARGE = -1}) and positrons ({\tt CHARGE = +1}) with kinetic
energy {\tt EEL} in the material indicated by {\tt I} in  
{\tt JMA = LQ(JMATE-I)}. It is called by the routine \Rind{GDRELA}.
\Shubr{GDRSGA}{}
{\tt CDRSGA} calculates the total cross-section in all materials for
delta rays for M\"{o}ller (\Pem\Pem) and Bhabha (\Pem\Pep)
scattering and for muons. 
It tabulates the mean free path, $ \lambda = 1/\Sigma $ (in cm) 
as a function of the medium and the energy.
The energy binning is set within the array {\tt ELOW} (common
\FCind{/GCMULO/})
in the routine \Rind{GPHYSI}. The following
pointers are used (see {\tt JMATE} data structure):
 
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{3cm}}l}
{\tt JMA = LQ(JMATE-I)}&pointer to the I$^{th}$ material \\
{\tt JDRAY = LQ(JMA-11)}&pointer to $\delta$-ray cross-sections\\
{\tt JDRAY}  &pointer for electrons                          \\
{\tt JDRAY+90} &pointer for positrons                        \\
{\tt JDRAY+180} &pointer for $\mu^+/\mu^-$.                    \\
\end{tabular}

The routine is called during initialisation by \Rind{GPHYSI}.

\section{Method}
Let: \[\frac{d\sigma(E,T)}{dT}\]
be the differential cross-section
for the ejection of an electron with kinetic energy $T$ by an incident
${e^{\pm}}$ of total energy $E$ moving in a medium of density $\rho$.
 
The variable {\tt DCUTE} in common \FCind{/GCCUTS/}
is the kinetic energy cut-off for the generated $\delta$-rays. 
Below this threshold the soft
electrons ejected are simulated as continuous energy loss by the incident
${\rm e^{\pm}}$, and above it they are explicitly generated.

The mean value of the energy lost by the incident ${\rm e^{\pm}}$ to
the soft $\delta$-rays is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys330-1}
E_{soft}(E,\mbox{\tt DCUTE})
= \int_{0}^{\mbox{\tt DCUTE}} \frac{d \sigma (E,T)}{dT} T \: dT
\end{equation}
whereas the total cross-section for the ejection of
an electron of energy $ T > \mbox{\tt DCUTE} $ is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys330-2}
\sigma (E,{\mbox{\tt DCUTE}})
= \int_{\mbox{\tt DCUTE}}^{T_{Max}}\frac{d \sigma (E,T)} {dT} \: dT
\end{equation}
where $T_{Max}$ is the maximum energy transferable to the free electron:
\begin{equation}
T_{Max} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
             E-m & {\rm for \hspace{.2cm} }  \Pep  \\
             (E-m)/2 & {\rm for \hspace{.2cm} }  \Pem , \\
              \end{array} \right . 
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the electron mass.
The method of calculation of the continuous energy loss
and the total cross-section are
explained below. {\tt [PHYS331]} deals with the explicit 
simulation of the $\delta$-rays.

\subsection{Continuous energy loss} 
The integration of (\ref{eq:phys330-1}) leads to the Berger-Seltzer formulae 
\notHTML{\cite{bib-BERG,bib-BETH,bib-BLOC,bib-EGS3,bib-STER,bib-MES1}}%
\HTML{\cite{bib-BERG}, \cite{bib-BETH}, \cite{bib-BLOC}, 
      \cite{bib-EGS3}, \cite{bib-STER}, \cite{bib-MES1}}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys330-3}
\frac {dE}{dx} = \frac{2 \pi r_0^ 2 mn }{\beta^2}
       \left [\ln \frac{2(\tau + 2)} {(I/m)^2}+ F^{\pm} (\tau , \Delta )
- \delta \right ],
\end{equation}
 where

\[
\begin{array}{LL}
\gamma           & \frac{E}{m}                           \\
\beta^2          & 1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}                  \\
\tau             & \gamma-1                              \\
\tau_c           & \frac{\mbox{\tt DCUTE}}{m}           \\
\mbox{\tt DCUTE}   &  \mbox{energy cut for} \: e^{\pm}      \\
\tau_{max}       & \mbox{maximum possible energy transfer in \Pem mass:
  $\tau$ for \Pep, $\tau/2$ for \Pem}  \\
\Delta           & \min(\tau_c,\tau_{max})              \\
n                & \mbox{electron density of the medium}        \\
I                & \mbox{average mean ionisation energy}        \\
\delta           & \mbox{density effect correction}.
\end{array}
\]
 
The functions $ F^{\pm}$  are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
F^+ (\tau,\Delta)& =& \ln(\tau\Delta ) -
\frac{\Delta^2}{\tau}\left[\tau + 2 \Delta -
\frac{3\Delta^2 y } {2} -\left(\Delta - \frac{\Delta^3 }{3} \right) y^2
- \left (\frac{\Delta^2}{2} - \tau
       \frac{\Delta^3}{3} + \frac{\Delta^4 } {4} \right)
          y^3  \right]  \\
F^- (\tau,\Delta )& =& -1 -\beta^2 +\ln \left [(\tau - \Delta)
\Delta \right ] + \frac{\tau}{\tau -\Delta}+\frac{\left [
\frac{\Delta^2}{2} + ( 2\tau +1) \ln
\left (1- \frac{\Delta}{\tau} \right ) \right ]}{\gamma^2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $ y = 1/(\gamma+1) $.
 
The density effect correction is calculated as in~\cite{bib-STER}:
\begin{equation}
\delta = \left\{\begin{array}{l@{\hspace{2cm}}l}
0                          & \mbox{if } x<x_0                        \\
2\ln 10 + x+C+a(x_1-x)^m  & \mbox{\phantom{if }}x_0 \leq x\leq x_1  \\
2\ln 10 + x+C             & \mbox{\phantom{if }}x_1<x,
\end{array}\right .
\end{equation}
where $ x = \ln(\gamma^2-1) / (2\ln 10) $
 The quantities n, I and the parameters of the density effect correction
($x_0, x_1, C, a, m$) are computed in the routine \Rind{GPROBI},
and we give the corresponding formulae here.
The electron density of the medium, n, can be written as

\begin{equation}
n = \left\{ \begin{array}{LL}

N_{Av} \rho \frac{Z}{A} & \mbox{for elements} \\ [.2cm]
N_{Av} \rho \frac{\sum_{i} n_i Z_i }{\sum_{i} n_i A_i} & 
\mbox{for compounds/mixtures, }
\end{array} \right .
\end{equation}

where

\begin{DLtt}{MMMMM}
\item [$N$]     Avogadro's number;
\item[$Z_i$]   atomic number;
\item[$A_i$]   atomic weight;
\item[$\rho$]    density of the material;
\item[$n_i$]     proportion by number of the $i^{th}$ element in the
        material (for a mixture 
       $n_i  = W p_i/A_i$
    where $p_i$ the proportion by weight and $W$ is the molecular
    weight).
\end{DLtt}

The average mean ionisation energy can be calculated as~\cite{bib-BERG}
\cite{bib-BETH} \cite{bib-BLOC} \cite{bib-EGS3}:

\begin{equation}
I (GeV) = \left\{ \begin{array}{LL}
16 \cdot 10^{-9} \; Z^{0.9} & \mbox{for a chemical element} \\
\exp \left [ \sum_{i} n_i Z_i \ln I(Z_i ) / \sum_i n_i Z _i \right ]
& \mbox{for a compound or mixture}
\end{array} \right .
\end{equation}
 
The density effect correction parameters can be computed (for
condensed medium \cite{bib-STER}) as
\begin{eqnarray*}
C & = & 1 + 2\ln \frac{I}{28.8 \cdot 10^{-9} \sqrt{\rho} \sum n_i Z_i /
              \sum n_i A_i }\\
m       &=& 3                          \\
x_a     &=& \frac{C} {2\ln 10}   \\
a       &=& 2\ln 10 \frac{(x_a -x_0)}{(x_1 - x_0 )}^m \\
\end{eqnarray*}
 
\begin{center}
$ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
I        &         C    &       x_0       &             x_1\\
\hline
<10^{-7} &        <3.681      &        0.2       &            2 \\
 <10^{-7}&        \geq 3.681  &      -0.326C-1   &            2 \\
\hline
\geq10^{-7} &       5.215     &       0.2         &          3 \\
\geq10^{-7} &      \geq 5.215 &       -0.326C-1.5 &         3 \\
\hline
\end{array}$\end{center}
 
\subsection{Total cross-sections} 
The integration of formula (\ref{eq:phys330-2}) gives the total cross-section 
\cite{bib-EGS4}, \cite{bib-MESS} for M\"{o}ller scattering ($\Pem\Pem$):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys330-9}
\sigma ( Z,E,\mbox{\tt DCUTE} ) =\frac {2 \pi r_0^2 mZ}{\beta^2(E-m)}
 \left[\frac{(\gamma-1)} {\gamma^2}\left(\frac{1}{x}-1\right)
             +\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{1-x}-\frac{2\gamma-1}{\gamma^2}\ln
\frac{1-x}{x}\right]
\end{equation}
and for Bhabha scattering ($\Pep \Pem $):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys330-10}
\sigma (Z,E,\mbox{\tt DCUTE}) =\frac{ 2 \pi r^2_0  mZ }
      {(E-m)}\left [\frac {1 }{\beta^2}  \left(\frac{1}{x}-1\right)
  + B_1 x + B_2 (1-x) -
 \frac {B_3 } {2} ( 1-x^2 ) +\frac{B_4}{3}(1-x^3)\right]
\end{equation}
where
 
\[
\begin{array}{L@{\hspace{3cm}}L}
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}       & \beta^2 = 1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2} \\ [.2cm]
 x     =\frac {\mbox{\tt DCUTE}}{E-m}  & \gamma=\frac{1}{\gamma + 1} \\ [.2cm]
 B_1=2-y^2                 &  B_2=(1-2y)(3+y^2)              \\ [.2cm]
B_3=(1-2y)^2+(1-2y)^3      &  B_4=(1-2y)^3
\end{array}
\]
 
The formulae [\ref{eq:phys330-9}] and [\ref{eq:phys330-10}]
give the total cross-section of the scattering
above the threshold energies 

\begin{equation}
T_{\rm Moller}^{\rm thr} =2\mbox{\tt DCUTE} \mbox{\hspace{2cm}and\hspace{2cm}}
T_{\rm Bhabha}^{\rm thr} = \mbox{\tt DCUTE}
\end{equation}
The interaction length for the production of $\delta$-rays is calculated
during initialisation by routine \Rind{GDRSGA}.

\section{Subroutines}
\Shubr{GDRAY}{}
\Rind{GDRAY} generates explicitly the delta-rays (see
{\tt [PHYS330]} for treatment of the ionization as continuous energy loss
and for the calculation of the total cross-section).
\begin{DLtt}{MMMMMMMMMM}
\item[input:]  common \FCind{/GCTRAK/}
\item[output:] common \FCind{/GCKING/}
\end{DLtt}
The routine is called from the tracking routines
\Rind{GTELEC}, \Rind{GTMUON}, \Rind{GTHION} and \Rind{GTHADR} 
when a charged particle reaches
its interaction point.
\section {Method }
\subsection{Differential cross-section}
The differential cross-section of the $\delta$-ray production can
be written as in equations (\ref{eq:phys331-1}, \ref{eq:phys331-2})
\cite{bib-MES1}, \cite{bib-EGS3}, \cite{bib-PDGB}. For the
electron/electron (M\"{o}ller) scattering we have:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys331-1}
\frac{d\sigma }{d \epsilon }=\frac{2 \pi Z r^2 _0 m }{\beta^2 (E-m)}
\left[ \frac{(\gamma -1 )^2}  {\gamma^2 }+\frac{1}{\epsilon}
\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}-\frac{2 \gamma -1 } {\gamma^2 } \right) +
\frac{1}{1- \epsilon}\left(\frac{1} {1- \epsilon} \frac{2 \gamma - 1}
{\gamma^2 }\right)  \right]
\end{equation}
and for the positron-electron (Bhabha) scattering:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phys331-2}
\frac{d \sigma}{d \epsilon}=\frac{2 \pi Z r^2_0 m }{(E-m)}\left[
\frac{1} {\beta^2 \epsilon^2}-\frac{B_1}{\epsilon}+B_2 - B_3 \epsilon
+ B_4 \epsilon^2\right]
 \end{equation}
 
where

\[
\begin{array}{LcL@{\hspace{1.6cm}}LcL}
Z        & = & \mbox{atomic number of the medium}   &
E        & = & \mbox{energy of the incident particle} \\ 
M        & = & \mbox{rest mass of the incident particle} &
\gamma   & = & \frac{E}{M}   \\ [.2cm]
\beta^2  & = & 1- \frac{1} {\gamma^2 } &
 y       & = & \frac{1} {\gamma + 1}               \\ [.2cm]
 B_1     & = & 2-y^2                   &
 B_2     & = & (1-2y)(3+y^2 )                       \\
 B_3     & = & (1-2y)^2+(1-2y)^3 &
 B_4     & = & (1-2y)^3  \\
\epsilon & = & \frac{T} {E-m}
\end{array}
\]

with $T$ the kinematic energy of the scattered electron (of the lower
energy in the case of $\Pem\Pep$ scattering).
 
The kinematical limits for the variable $\epsilon$ are:

\[
\epsilon_0 = \frac{\mbox{\tt TCUT}}{E-m} \leq \epsilon \leq \frac{1}{2}
\mbox{\hspace{.2cm} for \Pem\Pem} \hspace{2cm}
\epsilon_0 = \frac{\mbox{\tt TCUT}}{E-m} \leq \epsilon \leq 1
\mbox{\hspace{.2cm} for \Pep\Pem}
\]
For the other charged particles the differential cross-section
can be written:
\[
\begin{array}{LcLl}
\frac {d\sigma }{dT}&=& 2 \pi Z r^2_ 0 m\frac{1}{\beta^2 }\frac{1}{T^2}
\left[ 1- \beta^2 \frac{T} {\mbox{\tt TMAX }}\right] 
& \mbox{for spin 0 particle} \\ [.3cm]
\frac{d \sigma} {dT}&=& 2 \pi Z r^2_0 m \frac{1}{\beta^2 } \frac{1}{T^2}
\left[1- \beta^ 2 \frac{T}{ \mbox{\tt TMAX}}+ \frac{T^2} {2E^2}
 \right] &  \mbox{for spin 1/2 particle}
\end{array}
\]
where {\tt TMAX} is the maximum energy transferable to the free electron:
\[
\mbox{\tt TMAX} = \frac{2m(\gamma^2 -1)} {1+2\gamma (m/M) +
(m/M)^2}
\]
and {\tt TCUT} is the energy threshold for the $\delta$-ray emission:
$ \mbox{\tt TCUT} \leq T \leq \mbox{\tt TMAX} $

\subsection{Sampling} 
Apart from the normalisation, the cross-section can be written as
\[
\frac{d\sigma}{d\epsilon}=f(\epsilon) g(\epsilon),
\]
where, for $\Pem\Pem$ scattering,
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(\epsilon)&=&\frac{1}{\epsilon^2} \frac{\epsilon_0 }{1- 2\epsilon_0} \\
g(\epsilon)&=&\f
