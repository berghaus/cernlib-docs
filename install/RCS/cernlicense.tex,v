\section{CMZ}
CMZ  is  the product of a software company (CodeMe S.A.R.L.); and it uses parts
of the CERN Program Library. The following agreement has been  reached  between
CERN and the supplier:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item
CERN users will have the right to use CMZ on all machines on the CERN site.
\item 
In  CERN  member  states all institutions collaborating with CERN, national
research laboratories in nuclear and particle physics and academic  physics
departments will receive CMZ for free.
\item 
Groups  or  individuals  outside  CERN member states collaborating with the
experimental programme of CERN or of one of the institutions  mentioned  in
the previous paragraph will have the right to receive CMZ free of charge and to use it for the
work they are doing in the framework of the above  collaboration.  If  they
want  to  use  CMZ  for any other activity, then they must obtain a license
from the supplier.
\item 
All cases not directly covered by the above rules 1,2 and 3 will have to be
negotiated directly with the supplier. More information about
licence fees may be obtained from CODEME@@CERNVM.
\item 
The CERN agreement with the company includes  maintenance  and  development
coverage for users of CMZ in the first three categories listed above
\end{enumerate}
 
Individuals or institutions entitled to receive CMZ free of charge according to
the above conditions, should request the program and the documentation from the
CERN Program Library Office.

==================
LAPACK README FILE
==================

VERSION 1.0  :  February 29, 1992
VERSION 1.0a :  June 30, 1992
VERSION 1.0b :  October 31, 1992

DATE:  October 31, 1992

LAPACK is a library of Fortran 77 subroutines for solving
the most commonly occurring problems in numerical linear algebra.
It is public-domain software, and can be used freely.

The tar tape contains the Fortran source for LAPACK, the testing programs, and
the timing programs.

It also contains Fortran code for the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
(the Level 1, 2, and 3 BLAS) needed by LAPACK.
However this code is intended for use only if there is no other implementation
of the BLAS already available on your machine; the efficiency of LAPACK
depends very much on the efficiency of the BLAS.

The complete package, including test code and timing programs in four
different Fortran data types (real, complex, double precision, double
complex), contains some 600,000 lines of Fortran source and comments.
You will need approximately 28 Mbytes to read the complete tape.
We recommend that you run the testing and timing programs.
The total space requirements for the testing and timing for all four data
types, including the object files, is approximately 70 Mbytes.

A README file containing the information in this letter and a
QUICK\_INSTALL file containing a quick reference guide to the
installation process are located in the LAPACK directory.
Postscript and LaTeX versions of the Installation
Guide are in the LAPACK/INSTALL directory, in the files install.tex,
psfig.tex, install.ps, and org2.ps.  Consult the Installation Guide
for further details on installing the package and on what is contained
in each subdirectory.

It is highly recommended that you obtain a copy of the LAPACK
Users' Guide published by SIAM.  This Users' Guide gives a detailed
description of the philosophy behind LAPACK as well as an explanation of
its usage.  The LAPACK Users' Guide can be purchased from:
SIAM; 3600 University City Science Center; Philadelphia, PA 19104-2688;
215-382-9800, FAX 215-386-7999.  It will also be available from booksellers.
The Guide costs \$15.60 for SIAM members, and \$19.50 for non-members.
Please specify order code OT31 when ordering.  To order by email, send
email to service@@siam.org.

LAPACK has been thoroughly tested, on many different
types of computers.  The LAPACK project supports the package in the
sense that reports of errors or poor performance will gain immediate
attention from the developers. Such reports, descriptions
of interesting applications, and other comments should be sent by
electronic mail to lapack@@cs.utk.edu.

A list of known problems, bugs, and compiler errors for LAPACK is
maintained on netlib.  For a copy of this report, send email to
netlib@@ornl.gov with a message of the form: send release\_notes from lapack.

A number of working notes were written during the
development of LAPACK and published as LAPACK Working Notes,
initially by Argonne National Laboratory and later by the University
of Tennessee.  Many of these reports have subsequently appeared as journal
articles.  Most of these working notes are available in postscript form
from netlib.  To receive a list of available reports, send email to
netlib@@ornl.gov with a message of the form: send index from lapack/lawns.
Otherwise, requests for copies of these working notes can be sent to
the following address.
