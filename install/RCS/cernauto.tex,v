@\chapter{The CERN automatic installation system}

A system has been developed at CERN for the automatic
installation of CERNLIB sofware. This system currently
runs on Unix systems only. It consists of the following
components.

\begin{DLtt}{12345678901234567890}
\item[libserv]Script that permits a developer or installer to request
the installation of a new source file, the compilation of a program
or both. For example {\underline {\bf libserv put fatmen.car}} will
install the file {\bf fatmen.car} in the {\bf NEW} area on asis01
and on the {\bf NEWPAMS} disk on CERNVM (a copy is also made in \CMZ{}
format).
\item[nfscp]This script is invoked when a client issues a
{\underline {\bf libserv put}} command and copies the requested
file to the target directories.
\item[nfsmake]This script is invoked when a client requests that a
program is compiled, e.g. by {\underline {\bf libserv compile kernlib}}.
\item[asisserv]This is a slave script to {\bf nfsmake} that is invoked
on the target machines. 
\end{DLtt}

\section{nfsmake}

The {\it nfsmake} script can be used to rebuild all or parts of
the CERN Program Library on one or more machines. By default,
the library will be rebuilt on a list of machines that is defined
in the script itself. At the time of writing, the library is built
on the following platforms by default.

\begin{DLtt}{12345}
\item[apo]Apollo 68000 architecture (node a-cernli)
\item[a10]Apollo DN10000 architecture (node apofddi2)
\item[dec]DECstation (MIPS chip) (node dspaw)
\item[hpx]HP/UX (node hpcernlib)
\item[csf]HP/UX (node csf)
\item[parc]IBM RS6000 (node parcb)
\item[irs]IBM RS6000 (node rscnas01)
\item[irx]See below
\item[sgi]Silicon Graphics (nodes shift1 and shift9)
\item[lnx]IBM PC running LINUX operating system (node pcuslib)
\item[sun]SUN (node sunpaw)
\item[osf]Alpha OSF (node afcern)
\end{DLtt}

New machines can be added trivially.
