Abstract

CERN_MANAGE is a package of VMS command procedures useful for
maintaining the CERN software environment on a non-CERN VAX or
VAXcluster.  It was developed under VMS 5.5-2, and uses no
third-party or binary-executable code, other than native VAX/VMS
commands.  

The CERN_MANAGE system will make suitable additions to the VMS
system environment to support the full range(*) of CERN-defined
commands, as documented by CERN.  

(*) Tests have been made using the commands CERNLIB, PAW, RFRA,
RTOA, RFRX, RTOX, and the YPATCHY series.  Other CERN-defined
commands have not been tested due to lack of necessary software or
equipment.  

Latest Modifications: 

New routine, SYNCH_RDT.COM, used to override the default local
file modification date with the date of the file at CERN, to avoid
time-zone problems in incremental updates.
