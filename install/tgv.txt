With version 3.3 (February, 1994) of TGV Multinet TCP/IP software for openVMS,
it is possible to set the record size for binary transfers in FTP (previously
the only allowed sizes were 512 and 2048 bytes).  The commands are
RECORD-SIZE nnnnn when the ftp session originates on the openVMS computer, and
QUOTE SITE RMS RECSIZE nnnnn when ftp is started from the non-VMS end.
Here are examples of the two cases.  For a transfer starting on an
openVMS computer:

$ FTP SHIFT.CERN.CH
SHIFT.CERN.CH> USER yourname
<Password required for yourname.
Password:
<User leeiv logged in.
SHIFT.CERN.CH> VERSION
DUKPHY.PHY.DUKE.EDU MultiNet FTP user process 3.3(109)
SHIFT.CERN.CH> BINARY
Type: Image, Structure: File, Mode: Stream
SHIFT.CERN.CH> RECORD-SIZE 32400
SHIFT.CERN.CH> RECORD-SIZE
Record size for IMAGE files: 32400
SHIFT.CERN.CH> GET myfile.rzhist myfile.rzhist
SHIFT.CERN.CH> QUIT
$

For a transfer starting from a non-Multinet computer:

> ftp dukphy.phy.duke.edu
