----------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The installation has been made on:
 
    IBM RS6000-550 running AIX 2 3 (uname -svr)
    compilers used : (from the .lst file after compiling with 
    -xlf: IBM AIX XL FORTRAN Compiler/6000  Version 02.03.0000.0011
    -cc:  IBM AIX XL C Compiler/6000  Version 01.02.0000.0007

IMPORTANT: 
  IF you have an older version of the Fortran compiler(less than 2.3),
  you will get fflush_ as an unresolved external. You should get the
  up-to-date version of the compiler; even rebuilding the libraries
  will not help, as these calls are explicitely needed in (e.g.) kuip.

If you want to rebuild the libraries and/or binaries from the sources, 
please use the tools as given the the cernmgr.tar.Z; we no longer intend
to keep the tools in a patchy file.


Problems with installation ( only if you want/need to recompile yourself):
    Some of the tests for mathlib will fail. Under inverstigation.

Downloading and Installing the tar files on your machine
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
See the README.cernlib in the top level directory /
 
In short, you should "get" the files in binary mode into a
temporary directory.  Use plitar to unpack the files.  NOTE
however, that we have changed plitar since 93c and that you must take the
new version available in this directory. We added suppport to unpack .gz
files with gzip (see below).
 
The contents of each compressed tar file is documented in the
corresponding .contents file; e.g. for the cernlib.tar.gz, you
should check the file cernlib.contents.
 
Files specific to IBM/RS6k are compressed using gzip; files common to all 
architectures are available in both 'compress' and 'gzip' format.
A gzip.tar file (not compressed) and the gzip/gunzip/zcat programs are 
available in this directory. If you do not have gzip please take this tar 
file and untar it prior to using plitar.
