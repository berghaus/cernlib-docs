\section{Reaction initial state.}

\hspace{1.0em} The GEANT4 fission model is capable to predict 
final excited fragments as result of an excited 
nucleus  
symmetric or asymmetric fission.  The
fission process (only for nuclei with atomic number 
$A \geq 65$) is considered as a
competitor for evaporation process, when nucleus transits from an
excited state to the ground state.  The competiton with 
evaporation of neutrons,
protons, deutrons, nuclei of thritium and helium as well as 
photon evaporation is taken into
account. 

The initial information for calculation of fission
decay consists from the atomic mass number $A$, charge $Z$ of residual
(e. g. after kinetic stage) nucleus, its four momentum $P_0$, angular 
momentum $\vec{L}_0$ and  excitation energy $E^{*}$.   

This model is usualy used after the "kinetic" stage of nuclear interaction.
