\section{Resonance decay simulation.} 

\hspace{1.0em}Resonance decay channels are sampled according to the partial decay widths 
$\Gamma(m)$, 
which depend from masses $m$ of resonances.
All resonances decay isotropically in their rest
frame. For a two-particle decay the outgoing particle ($i,j$) momenta are given
by the Eq. ($\ref{SCD8}$). 
 If resonance is among the outgoing particles,
its mass is first determined according to a Breit-Wigner mass
distribution:
\begin{equation}
\label{DS2} F(m) = 
\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\Gamma(m_R)}{(m_R - m)^2 + \Gamma(m_R)^2/4}.
\end{equation}
  All pole masses $m_R$ and partial
decay widths $\Gamma_R$ are taken from the Review of Particle Properties
\cite{PDG96}.
 If the exit channel contains three or four particles, then
the respective $N$-body phase-space is taken into account for their
momenta.
