\section{Hadron propagation.}

\hspace{1.0em}
So far the hadrons are transported along the straight line paths (cascade 
approach), i. e. particle coordinates ${\bf r}$ for time "shift" 
between $t_0$ and 
$t_1$ are updated according to
\begin{equation}
\label{HP1} {\bf r}(t_1) = {\bf r}(t_0) + \frac{ {\bf p}(t_0)}{E(t_0)},
\end{equation}
where ${\bf p}$ and $E$ denote particles momenta and energies. 
The intranuclear nucleons are assumed to be "frozen" before collision,
i. e.  they are allowed to move only with the c. m. nucleus velocity.
However, their Fermi momenta are taken into account to find interaction
cross sections or characteristics of secondary particles produced in the
course of an intranuclear collision.
