\section{Stopped particle absorption algorithm.}

 The stopped particle absorption algorithm consists 
 from several steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sample position inside nucleus, where absorption takes place,
according to phenomenological probability distribution;
\item Simulate particle absorption according to particular particle absorption 
mechanism;
\item Using the hadron kinetic model perform propagation of final state 
(after absorption) particles;
\item Using correspondent deexcitation 
model perform decay of residual excited nucleus.
\end{enumerate}
