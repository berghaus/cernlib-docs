\section{Reaction initial state.}

\hspace{1.0em} The GEANT4 evaporation model is capable to predict 
final states as result of an excited nucleus with atomic number $A > 16$ 
break-up by the evaporation. 
 
The initial information for calculation of evaporation
stage consists from the atomic mass number $A$, charge $Z$ of residual
(e. g. after kinetic stage) nucleus, its four momentum $P_0$, angular 
momentum $\vec{L}_0$ and  excitation energy $E^{*}$.  

The evaporation
of $\gamma$'s,neutrons, protons, deutrons, thritiums, alphas, as well as 
the fission of heavy residual nuclei with $A > 65$ 
 are taken into account. 

This model is usualy used after the "kinetic" stage of nuclear interaction or 
after another break-up process as the fission or multifragmentation.
