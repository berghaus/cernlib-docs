\section{Evaporation model algorithm.}

 The evaporation model algorithm consists 
 from repeating steps of binary break-ups of 
the excited nuclear fragments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a nuclear fragment: assign atomic mass number $A$, electrical 
charge $Z$, fragment four vector $P_0$, fragment excitation energy $E^{*}$ and 
fragment angular momentum $\vec{L}_0$;
\item Calculate the probabilities of break-up channels and 
sample a channel;
\item Sample evaporated fragment $b$ kinetic energy at rest of decaying fragment;
\item Assuming isotropical evaporated fragments distribution, sample 
its flay off angles at rest of decaying fragment $b$;
\item boost the evaporated and residual fragment momenta into observer frame.
\item Calculate residual fragment  atomic mass number $A_f$, electrical 
charge $Z_f$, fragment four vector $P_f$, fragment excitation energy 
$E_f^{*}$ and 
fragment angular momentum $\vec{L}_f$;
\item Repeat this procedure starting from step (2)
 until no more fragment (the probabilities of break-up channels 
 equal zero) can be evaporated.
\end{enumerate}
