By the way of abstraction and code reuse we minimised the amount of code to be 
written and 
maintained. The concept of container-sampling lead to abstraction and 
encapsulation of data 
representation and the corresponding random number generators.
The Object Oriented design allows for easy extension of the cross-section base 
of the system, and the
ENDF-B VI data evaluations have already been supplemented with evaluated data 
on nuclear excitation
levels, thus improving the energy spectra of de-excitation photons.
Other established data evaluations have been investigated,
and extensions based on the JENDL\cite{JENDL}, CENDL\cite{CENDL}, and 
Brond\cite{Brond} data 
libraries are foreseen for next year.
