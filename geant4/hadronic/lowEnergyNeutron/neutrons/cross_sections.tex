All cross-section data are taken from the ENDF/B-VI\cite{ENDF} 
evaluated data library. 

All inclusive cross-sections
are treated as point-wise cross-sections for reasons of performance. 
For this purpose, the data from the evaluated data library have been processed, 
to explicitly include all neutron nuclear resonances in the form of
point-like cross-sections rather than in the form of parametrisations.
The resulting data have been transformed into a linearly interpolable format, 
such that the error due to linear interpolation between adjacent data points 
is smaller than a few percent.

The inclusive cross-sections comply with the cross-sections data set interface 
of the geant4 hadronic design.
They are, when registered with the tool-kit at initialisation, used 
to select the basic process. 
In the case of fission and inelastic scattering, point-wise
semi-inclusive cross-sections are also used in order to decide on the active 
channel
for an individual interaction. As an example, in the case of fission 
this could be first, second, third, or forth chance fission.
