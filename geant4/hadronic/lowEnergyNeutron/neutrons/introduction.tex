The neutron transport class library described here 
simulates the interactions of neutrons with kinetic energies 
from thermal energies up to O(20~MeV). The upper limit is set by
the comprehensive evaluated neutron scattering data libraries that the
simulation is based on.
The result is a set of secondary particles that can be passed on to the
tracking sub-system for further 
geometric tracking within geant4. 

The interactions of neutrons at low energies are split
into four parts in analogy to the other hadronic processes in geant4. 
We consider radiative capture, elastic scattering, fission, and 
inelastic scattering as separate models. These models
comply with the interface for use with the geant4 hadronic processes
which enables their transparent use within the geant4 tool-kit together with
all other geant4 compliant hadronic shower models.
