\chapter{Foreword}
\end{htmlonly}

This manual serves at the same time as a {\bf Reference manual}
and as a {\bf User Guide} for the \COMIS{} system.
Historically the following IHEP (Institute for High Energy Physics, Moscow Region,
Russia) people have worked on the \COMIS{} system:
V.~Bereshnoi, S.~Nikitin, Y.~Petrovych and V.~Sikolenko.
At CERN Ren\'e Brun has contributed to the development of the system.

In this manual examples are in {\tt monotype face} and strings to be
input by the user are \Ucom{underlined}.  In the index the page where
a routine is defined is in {\bf bold}, page numbers where a routine is
referenced are in normal type.

In the description of the routines a \Lit{*} following the name of a
parameter indicates that this is an {\bf output} parameter.  If
another \Lit{*} precedes a parameter in the calling sequence, the
parameter in question is both an {\bf input} and {\bf output}
parameter.
