\index{CST program}
 
This program produces a special file containing two
tables: the table of addresses for common-blocks and the
table of addresses for routines. The program takes the map-file
of the task as the input and produces the special-format file
with two tables as the output. Both tables can be
accessed later by the program dealing with \COMIS{}.
 
\Filename{H2comisasacst}
\section{PROGRAM ACST}
\index{ACST program}
 
This program takes a file of source card images as the input
and produces a file with one single subroutine with name \Rdef{CSCST}
as the output. This subroutine contains calls to
the \Rind{CSCOM} and \Rind{CSEXT} routines for all
common blocks and all routines containing in the input file.
The \Rind{CSCST} routine can be called later by the program dealing
with \COMIS{}.
