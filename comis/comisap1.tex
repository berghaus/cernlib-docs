For input/output streams \COMIS{} uses the following channels
by default:

\begin{DLtt}{1234567890}
\item[\textbf{\rm channel}]           \textbf{usage}
\item[lunsn =11]      for the system's needs.
\item[lunfil=12]      for input source code under the \Cind{\excl{}FILE} directive.
\item[lunlog=13]      for output into the LOG-file.
\item[lunmap=14]      for access to the MAP-file.
\item[lunedt=15]      for the local editor
\end{DLtt}
 
One can change the default values by

\Shubr{CSSETL}{(lunsn,lunfil,lunlog,lunmap,lunedt)}

before \COMIS{} system initialization.
 
In the case of PAW, these defaults have been changed to
81,82,83,84,85 respectively.
