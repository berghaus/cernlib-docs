\Filename{H2History}
\section*{History}

HBOOK is a Fortran\footnote{A C interface is also distributed by
the CERN Program Library, created using the tool f2h} callable 
package for histogramming and fitting.
It was originally developed in the 1970s and has since
undergone continuous evolution culminating
in the current version, HBOOK~4.
 
Many people have contributed to the design and development of HBOOK,
through discussions, comments and suggestions.
 
For many years and up to November 1994 Ren\'e Brun 
has been responsible for the HBOOK program.
Paolo Palazzi was involved in the original design.
D.~Lienart has been in charge of the parametrization part. 
Fred~James is the author of routine \Rind{HDIFF} and of the minimization
package Minuit, which forms the basis of the fitting routines.
The idea of Profile histograms has been taken from the HYDRA system.
The Column-wise-Ntuple routines were implemented by Fons Rademakers.
The multi-dimensional quadratic fit package \Rind{HQUAD} is the work of
John Allison.
J.~Linnemann and his colleagues of the D0 experiment contributed
the routine \Rind{HDIFFB}.
Pierre Aubert is the author of the routines to associate labels
with histograms.
Roger Barlow and Christine Beeston (OPAL) have developed the 
\Rind{HMCMLL} package.

\Filename{H2Preliminary-remarks}
\section*{Preliminary remarks}
 
This manual serves at the same time as a {\bf Reference manual}
and as a {\bf User Guide} for the HBOOK system.
After a short introductory chapter, where the basic ideas
are explained, the following chapters describe in detail
the calling sequences for the different user routines.
 
In this manual
examples are in {\tt monotype face} and strings to be input by the user 
are {\tt\underline{underlined}}.
In the index the page where a routine is defined is in {\bf bold},
page numbers where a routine is referenced are in normal type.

In the description of the routines a \Lit{*} following
the name of a parameter indicates that this is an {\bf output} parameter.
If another \Lit{*} precedes a parameter in the calling sequence, the
parameter in question is both an {\bf input} and {\bf output} parameter.

This document has been produced using \LaTeX~\cite{bib-LATEX}
with the \Lit{cernman} style option, developed at CERN. 
A gzip compressed PostScript file \Lit{hbook.ps.gz},
containing a complete printable version
of this manual, can be obtained from any CERN machine
by anonymous ftp as follows
(commands to be typed by the user are underlined):
