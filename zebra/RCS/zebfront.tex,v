\section*{Preliminary remarks}

This manual consists of several parts:

\begin{Itemize}
\item An overview of the ZEBRA system.
\item A reference section with a description of the DZ, MZ, FZ, 
      JZ91, RZ and TZ packages.
\item An example program showing how to use the MZ and DZ routines of ZEBRA.
\item A description of the DZDOC documentation system.
\item A list of the diagnostics messages generated by the FZ and MZ
      parts of the ZEBRA system.
\end{Itemize}

\subsection*{Conventions}

In this manual
examples are in \texttt{monotype face} and strings to be input by the user 
are {\Ucom{underlined}}.
In the index the page where a routine is defined is in {\bf bold},
page numbers where a routine is referenced are in normal type.

This manual flags output parameters in subroutine calls,
i.e. parameters which return values to the caller,
by an asterisk \Lit{"*"} following the argument's name.
If the input value of such a parameter is also significant
this is marked by prefixing a second asterisk.
A parameter which is a link is marked by an exclamation mark \Lit{"!"}.

The types of variables follow from the Fortran default typing
convention, except that variables beginning with the letters
"{\tt ch}" are of type {\tt CHARACTER}. 

The Fortran labelled \Lit{COMMON /\QUEST/IQUEST(100)} serves
for communication between the Zebra system and the user,
and also as scratch area in Zebra.

This document has been produced using \LaTeX~\cite{bib-LATEX}
with the \Lit{cernman} style option, developed at CERN. 
A gzipped compressed PostScript file \Lit{zebra.ps.gz}, 
containing a complete printable version
of this manual, can be obtained by anonymous ftp as follows
(commands to be typed by the user are underlined)%
\footnote{If you do not have the gnu {\tt gunzip} utility on your system
          you can get the uncompressed PostScript version by typing the
          command \Ucom{get zebra.ps}, without the {\tt gz} suffix. 
          In order to save Internet bandwidth, you are, however, strongly 
          urged to try and install the {\tt gunzip} utility since gzipped files 
          are about three times smaller than their unzipped equivalents.}:
