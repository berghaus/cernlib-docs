Notes:

 -- IFIRST and LAST may be 0, in this case all datawords of a bank will
    be listed.
 -- If no documentation for the bank exists, only the contents of the
    datawords will be shown (DZSHOW).
 -- Only two levels of repetitions are supported, the inner level must be
    given explicitly except for cases where the repetition count is a

    simple expression of the current data word.
