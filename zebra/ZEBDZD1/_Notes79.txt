Notes:

 -- The text on the title card *B.. is displayed by DZDISP (see figure
    ??) in the big box representing the data part of a bank. Sometimes a
    meaningful title is contained as data in the bank itself. To display
    this one may use the syntax: <tex2html erbatim ark>XMP23whereN1:
                                          v       m
    N2describestherangeofdatawordswithhollerithtext.IfFORMZisspecifiedthetextisfirstconvertedbyZITOHfromZEBRAinternalcharacterto ollerithformat.

Similiarly the fields where the hollerith Id, the numerical Id, and the
number of data words are displayed may be filled with text actually
contained in the bank itself using the syntax:
<tex2html erbatim ark>XMP24
         v       m
A picture showing a Monte Carlo decay tree in figure ?? was produced using
this feature.

The cards: *B.. and *B.UP are mandatory, all others are optional.
NDATA, NLINKS or NSLINKS may also be given as integer numbers.
When generating Fortran code, defaults are assumed as described in
section ??.
