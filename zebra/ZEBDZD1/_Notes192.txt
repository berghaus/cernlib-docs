Notes:

 -- Continuation cards should start with *B.  with the sequence number
    and mnemonic field left blank. (Note however the special mnemonics
    like BITVALnn, BITSnnmm etc. described above.)
 -- The program will try to put as many characters on an output line as
    will fit, embedded multiple blanks are removed unless the last
    character is a "/", in which case no formatting is done, except for

    the removal of leading blanks.
 -- The pair BKID and UPID, i.e. the identifiers of a bank and its
    up-bank should be unique in one RZ file. The system recognises the
    structure of the banks by looking for BKIDs, UPIDs and IDs of the
    banks described in the links.
 -- The value of JB on the card "*B.UP UPID-JB" is not used to recognise

    the structure but is printed only.
 -- Repetitions can be nested (3 levels maximum), each "*B.REP" requiring
    a "*B/REP".
