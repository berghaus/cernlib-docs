<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0011000000000000000> Purpose</A></H1>
<P>
The MZ package of ZEBRA helps the user to organize his data.
The purpose of the present JZ91 package is to assist him
in structuring his program.
It allows to formalize the concept of ``program module''
beyond the mere subroutine
and it provides the back-up service for these modules.
<P>
It is at the design stage of a program,
rather than later,
that the advantage of the JZ91 package will be most strongly felt,
since it provides a frame-work for the design;
again just like with the data structures of ZEBRA.
<P>
The program we are talking about will be designed as
a collection of modules called ``processors''.
The art consists in designing processors with interfaces
as simple and logical as possible,
and entirely documentable.
<P>
A given processor has a given task
which formalizes into a transformation of the input data structure
or rather sub-structure.
The result may be a modification of the input structure,
or a new output structure,
or just printed output and the like.
<P>
The processor is controlled by what is essentially a parameter list.
Normally this list contains pointers to the sub-structure
the processor is to work with.
Since links have to be held on relocatable memory
the parameter list is passed in a special purpose bank,
the ``call bank'',
containing reference links and data words.
This call bank is filled with the input parameters
by the higher level code which calls the processor.
The processor takes them from there and also places back
into the same call bank any output parameters,
in particular links to the output data structure,
if any has been lifted.
Clearly the content of the call bank is part of
the specification of the processor.
<P>
A processor may call other processors.
This is not to say that a good design should aim
at having processors at several levels.
On the contrary, the fewer levels one can do with
the better, of course.
Also, one should not write trivial processors
where simple subroutines will do.
<P>
By convention, every processor is entitled to have
the ZEBRA working space near the beginning of <tt>Q</tt>
freely to itself.
As a result a processor calling another processor
looses at that moment the content of its working space.
Its dimensions are saved by JZ91,
and they are automatically restored when control
comes back to the calling processor,
ie. it does not have to call <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ1/chapter2_1.html#MZWORK>MZWORK</A> again.
As an extra facility, JZ91 may be asked to save and restore
also the contents of the first so many links
and of the first so many data words of the working space.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0012000000000000000> JZ91 Services</A></H1>
<P>
JZ91 provides the following services
to an application software organized into processors:
<P>
- handling of ``call banks'' serving to transmit parametric
information of the link and data types
between processors at levels <tt>n-1</tt>, <tt>n</tt>, and <tt>n+1</tt>.
For the processor at call-depth <tt>n</tt> the ``up'' call-bank,
pointed to by the system link <tt>LQUP</tt>,
assures the communication with the higher level at
call-depth <tt>n-1</tt>;
and the ``down'' call-bank,
pointed to by <tt>LQDW</tt>,
communicates to the lower level at call-depth <tt>n+1</tt>.
Call banks of equal size are pre-lifted,
one for each level of a definite number of levels,
they stay permanently in memory.
<P>
- handling of ``processor constants'',
being part of the environmental data for each processor,
fixed during the run.
If a processor needs any constants at all,
it may initialize them itself,
this then being the default initialization.
By using titles, loaded with routine <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBTZ/chapter2_2.html#TZINIT>TZINIT</A>,
this default can be over-ruled.
The system link LQAN gives Access to these Numbers thus:
<P>
<PRE><TT>IQ(LQAN)   number of constants
               Q(LQAN+1) first constant
               . . .</TT></PRE>
<P>
- handling of ``processor conditions'' which may be signalled from
any processor with  <tt>CALL <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBJZ/chapter2_2.html#JZTELL>JZTELL</A> (J)</tt>,
<tt>J</tt> being a small integer normally from 1 to 10.
This provides for simple counters over the whole run
grouped by processors.
<P>
- handling of statistics of processor usage,
like number of times entered and time spent.
The number of times entered is accessible to
the processor in  <tt>IQ(LQSV+2)</tt>.
<P>
- saving the size of the working space,
on special request also the contents,
on down-call to the next processor
and restoring it on up-return.
<P>
- handling of ``processor flags'' for test runs during
program development.
The flags may be used to drive debug operations of
a processor without having to recompile it.
The flags for a given processor are defined by the user
on titles <tt>JZFL</tt> and they
are copied on entry to the processor into the vector <tt>JQFLAG</tt>,
ready for inspection by the code in the processor;
non-initialized flags are set to zero.
This is only available with the program-development
version of JZ91;
the production version presets all flags to zero
and leaves them thus for the whole run.
<P>
This ``environment'' information is held in
the bank of ``support variables'',
one bank for each processor,
which is permanently in store as part of the JZ91 data structure.
<P>
Communication between the processors and JZ91 is via:
<PRE><TT>COMMON /JZUC/LQJZ,LQUP,LQDW,LQSV,LQAN, JQLEV,JQFLAG(10)</TT></PRE>
JZ91 operates in and for one store only,
which must be the user's main store,
normally the primary store.
Links in the call bank can point only into this store.
