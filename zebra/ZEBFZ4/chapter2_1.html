<H1><A NAME=SECTION0011000000000000000> Native mode</A></H1>
<P>
In native mode
a data-structure is represented by a series of logical records (LR).
These records are written and read by Fortran <tt>WRITE</tt> and <tt>READ</tt>
statements.
<P>
Since indefinitly large records would cause problems in
auxiliary programs,
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> will make sure that no record exceeds the maximum
logical record size declared for the file with <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>,
breaking a chunk of information into several records if necessary.
Independently, the pilot record may not exceed 1024 words.
<P>
A data-structure starts with the 'pilot' record (type 2 or 3),
<A NAME=55><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><A NAME=56><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A>which may be continued with 'pilot continuation' records (type 4)
<A NAME=57><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><A NAME=58><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A>if necessary; this is followed by as many 'bank material' records

<P>
If the text vector is too large to fit into the pilot record
it is written out as a separate <tt>LRTYP=4</tt> continuation record:

<P>
The relocation table is written as a separate <tt>LRTYP=4</tt> continuation
record (or even several such records in the very unlikely case
that the table is larger than the maximum record length) if:
<P>
<UL><LI> text vector did not fit into the pilot record
<LI> table is too large to join the pilot record
<LI> table is longer than 40 words (because the buffer space for
      the 'early table words' in the control-bank associated to the
      file has this size) as follows:
<PRE><TT>word -1:  NWTAB
            0:  LRTYP=4
            1:  start of the relocation table, NWTAB words</TT></PRE>

<P>
<PRE><TT>word -1:  NWLR, the number of words in this record,
            excluding the first two words

      0:  LRTYP = 7 or 8, record type

      1 -&gt; NWLR:  the bank material</TT></PRE>
<P>
The bank material is dumped directly in sequential order
into either one or several records;
all but the last record are given the type <tt>LRTYP=7</tt>,
the last has <tt>LRTYP=8</tt>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0011600000000000000> Pilot: The segment table</A></H2>
<P>
Each entry has 3 words:
<P>
<UL><LI>    2 words are the Hollerith name of the division of origin,
<LI>    1 word indicates the number of words of bank material for 
         this segment.
</UL>The table on the file gives first the names of the divisions
for the segments, followed by the size indicators;
in both cases in the order in which the segments occur on the file,
which is also the order in which they where in memory at <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> time.
<P>
For example: suppose data from two divisions,
called <tt>'BGO'</tt> and <tt>'CALORIM'</tt>, where written.
Division <tt>BGO</tt> was physically lower in the store at output time
and delivered 21469 words, whilst division <tt>CALORIM</tt> gave 9199 words.
The segment table for this would consist of six words:
<P>
<PRE><TT>4HBGO , 4H    , 4HCALO, 4HRIM , 21469, 9199</TT></PRE>
<P>
If all the bank material comes from one single division only
the segment table is suppressed.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0011700000000000000> Pilot: The text vector</A></H2>
<P>
This is stored as a series of lines,
each line is preceded by a word-count indicating the number of
4-character Hollerith words to follow (this corresponds to the
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ1/chapter2_1.html#MZIOCH>MZIOCH</A> format <tt>'/*H'</tt>).
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0011800000000000000> Pilot: The relocation table</A></H2>
<P>
There is one entry for each contiguous section of memory,
containing an integral number of banks, which has been written
to the file. The entry consists of the original start address
of the section, followed by the end+1 address.
The entries follow each other in the table, thus:
<P>
<PRE><TT>word 1:  start adr of first storage region
            2:  end+1 adr of first storage region
            3:  start adr of second storage region
                 ...           ...
        NWTAB:  end+1 adr of last storage region</TT></PRE>
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0012000000000000000> Exchange mode</A></H1>
<P>
The exchange mode provides an interface between computers of
different architecture, through which data-structures can travel.
This interface has two distinct components:
<P>
<UL><LI> The <b>exchange data format</b> defines the representation
       of the data for the data-types allowed with ZEBRA:
       bit pattern, integer, floating, double-precision, Hollerith.
 <LI> The <b>exchange file format</b> defines the organisation of
       the data into logical records,
       and their blocking into physical records.
</UL>Normal blocking methods, such as IBM's VBS,
use control-information associated to every physical record;
for good reasons, because this provides safe and easy recovery to the
next logical record in case a physical record is lost.
In ZEBRA this could not be used because the intention was to provide
a format which would allow data-taking computers to dump rapidly
large amounts of data directly from memory to the file,
without copying through a buffer and without distroying the data
in the store,
which implies the use of physical records without
any control-information.
Such physical records we call 'fast blocks'.
We do however need a different kind of physical record,
which does provide control information,
and which can be used for recovery.
Such blocks are called 'steering blocks'.
Any data-structure starts on a steering block and may continue on as
many fast blocks as needed,
their number being recorded in the control-information of the
steering block.
<P>
To permit recovery, the steering blocks carry a particular bit
pattern on the first 4 words,
i.e. a pattern of 128 bits.
This reduces the a priori chance of a fast block
simulating a steering block to 1 in <PRE><TT>4.*10^{38}</TT></PRE>.
This is further reduced by contraints on the contents of the control
information for the steering block.
(To keep this probability low the user must not deliberately
use elements of this pattern as signals,
such as end markers.)
<P>
Some copy utilities copy a magnetic tape with suppression of faulty
blocks.
If a fast block of a particular data-structure is lost in this way,
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> would read the copy without getting an error signal
for the fast block,
and it would try to absorb the first block after the d/s,
a steering block, using it as data.
To prevent this, <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> is programmed never to accept as fast
a block which looks like a steering block.
If a d/s contains a genuine fast block simulating a steering block,
it will be lost.
The chance of this happening is sufficiently low to be tolerable,
as shown above.
<P>
A file to be read by <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> is not necessarily the result of <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>,
it may have been produced by a user program,
and this may not yet be fully debugged.
FZIN has been programmed to catch hopefully all logical errors
possible in the user's output routines,
and to give full diagnostics with logging level 4.
<P>
Whilst files in native mode can be written and read by identical
code on all machines,
specific code is provided for each type of machine
to read and write files in exchange mode.
Idiosyncracies of any given machine (like the ones of the VAX)
must remain local to the specific code of that machine.
This is an important principle,
as it avoids the combinatorial problem of every machine
having to know about all other machines.
Also,
it provides for a clean solution to the advent of a new machine,
or the disappearance of an obsolete machine.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0013000000000000000> Exchange Data format</A></H1>
<P>
The unit of information is a word of 32 bits,
(double-precision numbers require two words each).
A word may contain:
<P>
<PRE><TT>- positive integer:  true binary
 - negative integer:  two's complement of the absolute value
 - floating point:    IEEE standard as shown below
 - Hollerith:         4 character 8-bit ASCII, stored left to right
 - bit pattern:       32 bits of zero or one (no conversion)</TT></PRE>
<P>
The following reduction may occur when transforming
to the exchange representation on machines with a word-size
larger than 32 bits:
<P>
<PRE><TT>- integer:     'bad conversion' if more than 31 significant bits
 - floating:    reduced precision, but correctly rounded
 - Hollerith:   only the first 4 characters are taken
                 (trailing characters should be blank anyway)
 - bit pattern: only the right-hand 32 bits are taken</TT></PRE>
<P>
The following expansions may occur for the inverse transformation:
<P>
<PRE><TT>- Hollerith:   blank fill
 - bit pattern: zero-fill of the leading bits</TT></PRE>
<P>
The IEEE representation of
single and double precision floating-point numbers is:
<P>
<PRE><TT>Single precision:  1  bit  32       the sign-bit 's'
                   8  bits 31 - 24  the characteristic 'c'
                  23  bits 23 -  1  the mantissa 'm'

Double precision:  1  bit  64       the sign-bit 's'
                  11  bits 63 - 53  the characteristic 'c'
                  52  bits 52 -  1  the mantissa 'm'</TT></PRE>
<P>
A normal floating point number is represented by 3 fields
on one or two 32-bit words:
<P>
<tt>'m'</tt> is the fractional part of the mantissa M;
the binary point is assumed to be immediately to the left
of the most significant bit of m,
preceded by an implied 1 (hidden bit), for example:
<P>
<PRE><TT>m             M mantissa       decimal value

         0000...0      1.0000...0       1.
         1000...0      1.1000...0       1.5
         1100...0      1.1100...0       1.75</TT></PRE>
<P>
<tt>'c'</tt> is the characteristic, being the binary exponent with a bias of
127 or 1023 added, for example:
<P>
<PRE><TT>c             exponent        c              exp

         011...101     -2              100...000      1
         011...110     -1              100...001      2
         011...111      0              100...011      3</TT></PRE>
<P>
A normal floating-point number does not have a c of all ones
or all zeros, such characteristics are used to represent Exceptions.
<P>
<tt>'s'</tt> is the sign-bit, the number is negative if this bit is on.
The representation of floating-point numbers is of the
sign/magnitude form, ie. only the sign-bit is complemented
to change the sign of the number.
<P>
The Exceptions are:
<PRE><TT>c=0, m=0            floating-point zero
   c=0, m= not 0       'de-normalized number',
                       value:   +/-  0.m  *  2**(-126 or -1022)
   c=all 1, m=0        signed infinity  (c=255 or 2047)
   c=all 1, m= not 0   'not a number (NaN)'</TT></PRE>

The logical records of the exchange file format look much like those

<P>
A file in exchange file format is supported by physical records of
identical length (fixed-length records), this being the only
format which can safely be read on all machines.
A physical record consists of <tt>NWPHR</tt> words;
the word size is 32 bits for the Exchange Data Format,
for the Native Data Format it is the word size of the machine.
<P>
The physical record size <tt>NWPHR</tt> is 900 words standard,
but a different size may be specified at OPEN time.
For the Exchange Data format, <tt>NWPHR</tt> must be a multiple of 90 words,
ie. 360 bytes = 64x5x9 bits,
this being the smallest size compatible with all machines.
<P>
The following table shows, for the Exchange Data Format,
some possible values of <tt>NWPHR</tt>, being multiples of 90 words.
On machines with a word size of more than 32 bits the apparent
record size, which may be needed in JCL, will be less;
this is also shown, supposing that packing is dense.
<P>

<P>
<b>Note</b>: with Zebra version 3.61
the '90 word rule' has been relaxed such that the size of
physical recods is required to be a multiple of 30 words only.
One should not take advantage of this if one has 36-bit machines
in the experiment.
<P>
There are two kinds of physical records:
the <b>steering</b> blocks start with 8 words of control information;
the <b>fast</b> blocks have no control information at all.
<P>
Several fast blocks in succession are called a <b>burst</b>;
each burst of fast blocks is preceded by a steering block,
whose control information indicates the number of fast blocks
to be expected.
<P>
The format of a steering block is as follows:
<P>

 +4  word 5:  bits  1 -&gt; 24: NWPHR, the physical record length
                               (in 32-bit words)

              bits 25 -&gt; 32: flag bits:

                               31 end-of-run
                               30 start-of-run in this block

 +5  word 6:  physical record counter (fast blocks do not count)
               to permit checking for blocks lost by read errors;
               if zero: no checking

 +6  word 7:  NWTOLR, the off-set to the first logical record
               starting in this block:

               unless NWTOLR=0, the first new LR in this block starts
               at word NWTOLR+1, this word being its record size.

               if NWTOLR = 0: the whole block continues data
                               of the current logical record.

 +7  word 8:  NFAST, the number of fast blocks to follow just behind
               the current steering block

either as 16-bit half-words or as 32-bit words, unsigned or signed,
are:

<P>
To see the implications of this format, let us sketch what
an output routine would have to do which has <tt>NWD</tt> words
in a vector <tt>MDATA</tt> in a common <tt>/DATA/</tt> already in exchange data format,
say they are all integers,
to be written out as a Zebra file in exchange file format.
<P>
It has to preceed this vector by four kinds of control information,
going backward in this order:
<P>
<UL><LI> add the bank system words to make it into a Zebra bank
<LI> add the pilot information
<LI> add two words to make it into a logical record
<LI> add eigth control words to make the first physical record,
      a steering block
</UL>Most of this information can be set up once by initialization,
and only a few holes must be filled in for each data-structure.
In particular, the user header vector which identifies the
structure must be filled,
in the example we chose a header of 4 words.
Remember that all numbers must be in exchange representation;
but most numbers are positive integers, and hence are no problem.
Numbers where one has to be careful are flagged by <tt>!!</tt>,
numbers which must be re-filled are marked by <tt>*</tt>.
