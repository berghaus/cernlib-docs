\section*{Preliminary remarks}

The present manual consists of four parts:

\begin{OL}
\item An overview of the ZEBRA system.
\item A reference section with a description of the ZEBRA DZ routines.
\item An example program showing how to use the MZ and DZ routines of ZEBRA.
\item The description of the DZDOC system
\end{OL}

In this manual
examples are in {\tt monotype face} and strings to be input by the user 
are {\tt\underline{underlined}}.
In the index the page where a routine is defined is in {\bf bold},
page numbers where a routine is referenced are in normal type.

This document has been produced using \LaTeX~\cite{bib-LATEX}
with the \Lit{cernman} style option, developed at CERN. 
A PostScript file \Lit{zebradz.ps}, containing a complete printable version
of this manual, can be obtained by anonymous ftp as follows
