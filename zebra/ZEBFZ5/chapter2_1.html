<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0013000000000000000> ALFA exchange format</A></H1>
<P>
To allow files in exchange mode to travel on networks which
cannot handle binary file transfer, a conversion to and from
card-images is provided.
This uses a sub-set of the 64-character ASCII set
to represent the binary contents of a file
in exchange file and data format.
<P>
The easiest way, from the coding point-of-view,
would be to generate a hexadecimal dump of the binary file.
But this is too simple in several respects:
<P>
<UL><LI> markers must be provided to mark the start and the end of the
      original physical record, to be used for recovery of read errors
      and for fast skipping of unwanted records.
<LI> the hexadecimal dump of one word would give 8 characters,
      taken from a set of 16 characters.
      In this case 4 bits are represented by one character.
      This is wasteful,
      and we use a set of 32 characters,
      each representing 5 bits, and hence we need 7 characters
      for each word (at most).
      If one were to represent 6 bits by one character,
      one could represent one word on 6 characters,
      but one would need a 64 character set;
      this we consider to be too tight.
<LI> compression of sets of consecutive identical words, and
<LI> special dense representations of short integers and exact
      floating point numbers should be provided, to make the ALFA file
      as short as possible,
       in order to save network transmission time.
</UL><H3><A NAME=SECTION0013010000000000000> File format</A></H3>
<P>
The file produced or expected by <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>/<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> 
in '<tt>ALFA</tt> mode' consists
of card-images of 80 columns exactly, written by FORTRAN formatted
WRITE statements.
Column 1 of all lines is blank,
except for the first and the last line representing
the start and the end of an original physical record.
Blocking, if any, is under control of the user with the JCL.
On an IBM the character set is EBCDIC,
on a CDC Display code, on most other machines it is ASCII.
Translation, if any, is expected to happen in the network
stations.
Such files are not written to tape.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION0013020000000000000> Number representation</A></H3>
<P>
An original 32-bit binary word is unpacked onto seven 5-bit bytes:
<P>
<PRE><TT>I(1) = bits 31,32
      I(2) = bits 26 -&gt; 30
          ...
      I(6) = bits  6 -&gt; 10
      I(7) = bits  1 -&gt;  5</TT></PRE>
<P>
In general this word is represented by 7 characters:
<P>
The first character <tt>C(1)</tt>, called the type-character,
combines the information <tt>I(1)</tt> with more information about possible
shortening of the representation.
<P>
The remaining 6 bytes <tt>I(j)</tt> are translated into the characters <tt>C(j)</tt>
whose <tt>CETA</tt> values are <tt>I(j)+1</tt>:
<P>
<PRE><TT>value  0 1 2 ... 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31

<P>
Small integers contain several leading bytes of value zero
(or 31 for negative integers),
the number <tt>N</tt> of such bytes is encoded into <tt>C(1)</tt>,
and the characters <tt>C(2 to N+1)</tt> are not output.
A similar scheme is applied to words with trailing bytes
<tt>I(j to 7)</tt> of value zero.
<P>
Very small positive integers, with value less than 10,
are given a one character representation,
and the encoding for <tt>C(1)</tt> is arranged such that the integers
0 to 9 stand for themselves.
<P>
The construction of <tt>C(1)</tt> is shown by this figure:

<tt>'x'</tt> stands for any value not zero,

One can see that main types 1 to 4 cover the general case and also
shortening for trailing zero bytes.
Main types 5 and 6 cover positive and negative short integers,

<H2><A NAME=SECTION0013100000000000000> Compression of sets of consecutive identical numbers</A></H2>
<P>
This is done by following the first number of the set by the
special character <tt>'='</tt>, not a member of the ordinary
type-characters <tt>A</tt> to <tt>Z</tt>,  <tt>0</tt> to <tt>9</tt>,
<tt>+</tt> to <tt>(</tt>, followed by the short integer <tt>N</tt> 
(represented like all other integers).
This signals to the reading program that the last number has to
be repeated <tt>N+1</tt> times.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION0013110000000000000> Examples:</A></H3>
<P>
<PRE><TT>XBA=YU   XBA and YU are the small integers 32 and 20,
             hence this stands for 22 words containing 32.

    /45=9    /45 and 9 are the small integers -33 and 9,
             hence this stands for 11 words containing -33.

    0=XMO    0 and XMO are the small integers 0 and 398,
             hence this stands for 400 words of all zeros.</TT></PRE>

<H2><A NAME=SECTION0013300000000000000> Start and End of physical record</A></H2>
<P>
The first line of the dump of each physical record carries the
special character <tt>'&gt;'</tt> in column 2, normally also in col. 1.
Column 3 of the first line has <tt>'0'</tt> or <tt>'1'</tt> if the record is a
fast or a control record.
The last line carries the symbol <tt>'&lt;'</tt> in column 1.
The last number of the record, normally on the last line,
is followed by <tt>'&lt;'</tt>, followed by the two check-sum numbers.
The check-sums are obtained by addition,
separately for bits 17 to 32 and bits 1 to 16,
of the binary value of each number written.
A second <tt>'&lt;'</tt> could be given instead of the 2 check-sum numbers
to suppress the check.

<H1><A NAME=SECTION0014000000000000000> Coding Zebra user I/O</A></H1>
<P>
On UNIX machines, and if Zebra has been installed with the
<tt>FZLIBC</tt> option, one can select user I/O for a particular
file by giving the <tt>K</tt> option to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>.
As with the <tt>L</tt> option this causes the I/O requests to be
channelled to the routines <A HREF=#CFPUT>CFPUT</A>, 
<A HREF=#CFGET>CFGET</A>, etc.
<P>
To code user I/O one has to take the source of these
routines and add a new branch, or two, into each one
to do what one wants to do.
<P>
One finds the source of these routines on the Pam file
KERNFOR in <tt>P=CCGENCF</tt>; there is also the Fortran dummy
routine <tt>P=TCGEN, D=CFWEOF</tt> to write system file-marks.
Careful, it is possible that there is a machine-specific
implementation of these routines; for example if one
wanted to do this on the Sun one should check that
KERNSUN does not contain versions of these routines
(it does not right now).
<P>
The second parameter for each routine is <tt>MEDIUM</tt>,
and on entry its value selects the wanted branch.
<tt>MEDIUM</tt> is 0,1,2,3 for <tt>L,TL,K,TK</tt> selected 
with <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A> for the that file.
Be careful not to destroy the existing path.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0015000000000000000> Byte inversion on the VAX</A></H1>
<P>
The problem arises because the VAX, and also DECstation,
loads computational registers with bytes of increasing address
starting at the right moving to the left, whilst tape, disk, and
memory are mapped according to increasing byte address.
For example, supposing we had an exchange format record
starting with the following numbers:
<P>
<PRE><TT>1 - bit pattern:          hex  0123CDEF
  2 - integer:        292   hex  00000124
  3 - floating:       1.0   hex  3F800000
  4 - Hollerith:     ABCD   hex  41424344
  ...</TT></PRE>
<P>
the record would start with the following bytes:
<P>
<PRE><TT>number:    1  2  3  4   5  6  7  8   9 10 11 12  13 14 15 16  ...
   value :   01 23 CD EF  00 00 01 24  3F 80 00 00  41 42 43 44  ...</TT></PRE>
<P>
Reading the record to memory will transmit the bytes in this
order to increasing byte addresses, but under the VAX optic
showing association to registers we have to write it as:
<P>
<PRE><TT>number:   ...  16 15 14 13  12 11 10  9   8  7  6  5   4  3  2  1
   value :   ...  44 43 42 41  00 00 80 3F  24 01 00 00  EF CD 23 01</TT></PRE>
<P>
This is right as it is only for Hollerith
(for which this scheme has been designed, of course),
but it is upside-down for integers and bit patterns;
floating-point has to be converted anyway.
<P>
Since all the control-information is integer,
and Hollerith is relatively rare,
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> on the VAX for simplicity (and speed)
converts the whole record with one call (to VXINVB),
inverting the 4 bytes of each word, giving:
<P>
<PRE><TT>number:   ...  16 15 14 13  12 11 10  9   8  7  6  5   4  3  2  1
   value :   ...  41 42 43 44  3F 80 00 00  00 00 01 24  01 23 CD EF</TT></PRE>
<P>
Conversion from Exchange Data Format to VAX internal
transforms only floating-point and Hollerith,
the integers being ready, giving:
