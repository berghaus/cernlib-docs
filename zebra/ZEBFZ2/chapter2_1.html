<H1><A NAME=SECTION0011000000000000000> Representation of a data-structure</A></H1>
<P>
The unit of information on a ZEBRA file is the
<b>data-structure</b>.
It may consist of zero, one, two, or more
<b>data-segments</b>.
The data-segments reflect the original residence of different
parts of the data-structure in different divisions at the
moment when the d/s was transferred from memory to the file with
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>.
When the d/s is transferred back from the file to memory with <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>
individual data-segments may be directed to separate divisions,
or may be ignored.
<P>
User information which may be associated with each d/s is
the 'user header vector',
specified and received via parameters to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> and <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>,
and the 'text vector' taken from and delivered to the text-buffer
associated to the file with <A HREF=#FZTXAS>FZTXAS</A> (implementation of this routine
is pending).
<P>
On the file the data-structure is represented
by the 'pilot information' followed by the 'bank material'.
The pilot carries all the control and context information,
namely:
<P>
<UL><LI> the amount of memory required to receive the data-structure;
<LI> the entry address into the data-structure, if any;
<LI> the user-header vector with its I/O characteristics, if any;
<LI> the text-vector, if any;
<LI> the segment table, if any, describing which data segment comes
      from which division;
<LI> the relocation table, if any, describing the original position
      in memory of each contiguous set of banks, needed to update
      all links in the data-structure for the new positions in
      memory on input.
</UL>This is followed by the 'bank-material',
which carries the copy of the memory regions originally occupied
by the banks of the data-structure.
The data-structure may in fact be empty,
in which case there is no bank-material.
<P>
In Native Data Format the bank material on the file
is a simple dump of the memory;
but in Exchange Data Format the numbers have to be transformed
from the internal to the exchange representation.
To make this possible automatically,
every bank has to carry its 'I/O characteristic' describing
the integer/floating/Hollerith nature of its contents exactly;
see the descriptions of the routines <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ1/chapter2_1.html#MZLIFT>MZLIFT</A>
and <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ1/chapter2_1.html#MZBOOK>MZBOOK</A>.
Banks of type 'undefined' cannot be transported.
<P>
The exact details for the file and data formats
are found in Chapter <A HREF=#secH1FZformatspecs><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0012000000000000000> Events, Runs, and Files</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME=seceventsrunsfiles><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A>
<P>
The unit of information on a ZEBRA file is the data-structure.
<P>
Several data-structures may be (but need not)
be grouped into an <b>event</b>.
On the file events are separated by the 'start-of-event'
flag being present in the first data-structure of each event.
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> may be asked to skip forward to and read the next
'start-of-event' data-structure.
<P>
Several events (or d/s) may (but need not) be grouped into a
<b>run</b>.
On the file the start and the end of a run are marked by
special <b>StoR</b> and <b>EoR</b> records written by calling <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZRUN>FZRUN</A>.
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> may be asked to skip forward to and read the next
'start-of-run' record.
(Skipping forward to next run or event should not be used
for the medium Memory or Channel.)
<P>
A ZEBRA file has to be terminated.
The writing of End-of-File is a perennial problem,
as the requirements for different kinds of files are
different for different machines and different media.
Thus for example, on the IBM system MVS one should not terminate
a disk file by an ENDFILE statement,
as this inhibits the release of the unused space on the disk.
A tape, on the other hand,
should be terminated by a double EoF which may or may not be
provided by the system, yet on the VAX the program will collapse
if one tries to ENDFILE an unlabelled tape.
<P>
In principle, a Zebra file may logically consist of several
files on the same medium.
To implement this rigorously on all machines the special
<b>Zebra EoF</b> record is provided
(an end-of-run record which immediately follows a true end-of-run
is also interpreted as EoF).
It is written by a call to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZENDO>FZENDO</A> with one of the options
T, N, C, or I.
<P>
Whether or not the writing of a Zebra EoF signal is followed
by the explicit request to write one or two system file-marks
(for end-of-file or end-of-data)
depends on the circumstances.
Most machines do not support multi-file disk files,
and some machines do not even support multi-file tape files.
<P>
In first approximation, a Zebra file is assumed not to
contain imbedded system file-marks.
For output this means that no file-marks are written explicitly,
leaving the file termination to the system;
for input it means that a system file-mark is interpreted
as 'end-of-data'.
A different behaviour can be selected when calling <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>
by setting the <tt>NEOF</tt> parameter associated with the file
to 1, 2, or 3  as explained in section <A HREF=chapter2_1.html#secFZFILE>8.4</A>.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION0013000000000000000> Outline of usage for medium Disk or Tape</A></H1>
<P>
Before using FZ, the routines <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ1/chapter2_1.html#MZEBRA>MZEBRA</A> and 
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ1/chapter2_1.html#MZSTOR>MZSTOR</A> must have been called.
FZ uses the system division of the primary store to hold
the control-information about all its files.
One bank per file is used, containing the parameters of the file,
the statistics of usage of the file,
and also the physical record buffer,
if the file format is 'exchange'.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0013100000000000000> Initialization</A></H2>
<P>
Before using a particular file,
it should be <b>opened</b>,
normally with the Fortran OPEN statement
or with the C interface routine <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#CFOPEN>CFOPEN</A>
(except for files which are read/written by special
machine-dependent packages, such as IOPACK on IBM).
The ZEBRA handling of this file must be <b>initialized</b>
by calling <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>.
<P>
Machine-dependent details about opening files are given in 
chapter <A HREF=#secH1FZexchangemode><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
The call to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A> specifies the properties of the file
and the processing direction, for example:
<PRE><TT>CALL FZFILE (LUN,0,'.')    native mode, input only, disk file

    CALL FZFILE (LUN,0,'IO')   native mode, disk file,
                               input-output or output-input,

    CALL FZFILE (LUN,0,'XO')   exchange mode, output only, disk file

    CALL FZFILE (LUN,0,'D')    exchange mode, input only, disk file
                               reading with direct-access Fortran

    CALL FZFILE (LUN,0,'TL')   exchange mode, input only,
                               tape file to be read via the C Library</TT></PRE>
Note that the Fortran systems on some Unix machines,
like on Sun or Silicon Graphics,
are not capable of handling fixed-length records in sequential mode,
ie. <tt>RECORDTYPE='FIXED'</tt> is not available in their Fortran
OPEN statement.
In this case one has to use the direct-access mode,
or the C library mode, of FZ for exchange format files.
<P>
If one is debugging a program,
it can be useful to set the logging level of FZ for this file
to 2 with
<PRE><TT>CALL FZLOGL (LUN,2)</TT></PRE>
causing FZ to print a log message
whenever it is called for this file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0013200000000000000> Input</A></H2>
<P>
To simply read the next data-structure, one calls for example with:
<PRE><TT>PARAMETER   (NUHMAX=100)
      DIMENSION    IUHEAD(NUHMAX)
      COMMON /QUEST/IQUEST(100)

      NUH = NUHMAX
      CALL FZIN (LUN, IXDIV, LSUP,JBIAS, '.', NUH,IUHEAD)
      IF (IQUEST(1).NE.0)    GO TO special</TT></PRE>
This will read the next d/s into the division indicated by <tt>IXDIV</tt>,
it will transfer the user-header-vector into <tt>IUHEAD*</tt>,
<tt>NUHMAX</tt> words at most, returning in <tt>*NUH*</tt> its useful size.
It will connect the d/s read into a higher level d/s (if any)
according to the parameters <tt>!LSUP</tt> and <tt>JBIAS</tt>,
which have the same significance as with <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ1/chapter2_1.html#MZLIFT>MZLIFT</A> or <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ2/chapter2_1.html#ZSHUNT>ZSHUNT</A>.
<P>
On normal completion <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> returns <tt>IQUEST(1)=0</tt>;
a positive value indicates an exception,
like Start-of-run or End-of-data;
a negative value signals trouble.
<tt>IQUEST(1)</tt> <b>must</b> be tested after every call to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>.
<P>
Frequently one is interested in processing only a particular
kind of data-structure, wanting to rapidly skip any others
which might be on the file.
To make this possible the data must be organised to contain
all the information relevant to selection in the user header vector,
because one can ask <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> to start the d/s by reading
the pilot information only, delivering the user header vector to
the caller, leaving the bank-material in suspense,
waiting for a decision.
If the d/s is to be rejected, all the work of bringing
it into memory with adjustment of the links can be saved.
<P>
To get the user header vector of the next d/s one specifies
the S option (Select) in a first call to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>;
a second call with the A option will transfer the d/s to memory,
for example:
<PRE><TT>C--       Ready to select next d/s

   11 NUH = NUHMAX
      CALL FZIN (LUN, IXDIV, 0,0, 'S', NUH,IUHEAD)
      IF (IQUEST(1).NE.0)    GO TO special
      IF (not wanted)        GO TO 11

C--       Accept pending D/S

      CALL FZIN (LUN, IXDIV, LSUP,JBIAS, 'A', 0,0)
      IF (IQUEST(1).NE.0)    GO TO special</TT></PRE>
Whilst accepting is done by an explicit call with the A option,
rejection is done implicitly by asking for the next d/s.
<P>
Having reached the end of the input file (or having decided
to stop input for some other reason),
one can get the statistics of file usage printed by
<PRE><TT>CALL FZENDI (LUN,option)</TT></PRE>
'option' indicates the further action to be taken on this file,
such as REWIND and re-start reading from the beginning,
or start writing on the file positioned by reading it,
or simply terminate.
<P>
Beware: for exchange format files one can switch from input
to output only after having read an end-of-run or end-of-file.
<P>
If one wants to read several different files on the same
logical unit number (thereby possibly saving I/O buffers
in the system), this can be done as indicated by this sketch,
provided all the files have the same characteristics:
<PRE><TT>OPEN (LUN,FILE=&lt;file 1&gt;,...)
      CALL FZFILE (LUN,0,opt)
         read first file
      CALL FZENDI (LUN,'NX')            new file to be connected

      OPEN (LUN,FILE=&lt;file 2&gt;,...)
         read second file
      CALL FZENDI (LUN,'NX')

      OPEN (LUN,FILE=&lt;file 3&gt;,...)
         read third file
            . . . . .</TT></PRE>
If the files are <b>not</b> of the same kind,
for example if the first file is in native mode
and the second file is in exchange mode,
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZENDI>FZENDI</A> must be told to forget all about the first file,
so that a new file can be started on the same
logical unit number, for example:
<PRE><TT>OPEN (LUN,FILE=&lt;file 1&gt;,...)
      CALL FZFILE (LUN,0,'.')           native mode
         read first file
      CALL FZENDI (LUN,'TX')            terminate

      OPEN (LUN,FILE=&lt;file 2&gt;,...)
      CALL FZFILE (LUN,0,'X')           exchange mode
         read second file
      CALL FZENDI (LUN,'TX')</TT></PRE>
(This is necessary because the size and character
of the FZ control bank depends on the nature of the file.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0013300000000000000> Output</A></H2>
<P>
It may be desirable to group the output into 'runs',
in which case one would start a new run with, for example:
<PRE><TT>JRUN = run number
         . . .
      CALL FZRUN (LUN,JRUN,0,0)</TT></PRE>
It is possible to store user information into the 'start-of-run'
record via the last two parameters of the call.
There is however the danger,
if this information is essential for the processing of the
data of the run,
that the start-of-run record may get lost due to read errors.
<P>
(An end-of-run record can be requested explicitly,
but normally this is not necessary, since it is triggered
by a new run, or by <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZENDO>FZENDO</A>.)
<P>
To ouput a d/s from the primary store,
supported by the bank at <tt>!LHEAD</tt>,
together with a user header vector in <tt>IUHEAD</tt> of <tt>NUH</tt> integer words,
one may call:
<PRE><TT>CALL FZOUT (LUN,0,LHEAD,0,'L',2,NUH,IUHEAD)</TT></PRE>
In this case, the material to be output is defined solely by
the entry address <tt>!LHEAD</tt> into the d/s.
Therefore <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> has to do a logical walk through the complete d/s
by following all the structural links, to mark all the banks
belonging to this d/s.
A subsequent sequential scan over the memory constructs
the table of the memory regions to be output.
For a large d/s the time spent on this operation may be
non-negligible;
it can be saved if the user has organized his data such
that the d/s to be output resides in a separate division
(or divisions) of which it has exclusive use.
In this case one can instruct <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> to simply
output the complete division <tt>IXDIV</tt> (or divisions <tt>IXDIV1 + IXDIV2</tt>),
whithout the need for the logical walk, by calling:
<PRE><TT>[ IXDIV = MZIXCO (IXDIV1,IXDIV2,0,0) ]

      CALL FZOUT (LUN,IXDIV,LHEAD,0,'D',2,NUH,IUHEAD)</TT></PRE>
The entry address <tt>!LHEAD</tt> is still needed,
no longer to define the data to be written,
but for the receiver to find his way into the d/s read.
<P>
Although option 'D' saves the logical walk,
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> still has to do the sequential scan of the division[s]
to identify the live banks to be written,
and the dead banks to be suppressed.
If the user knows that there are no dead banks,
or that their volume is negligible,
he can indicate this to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> with the <tt>DI</tt> option,
causing it to write the complete division[s] as it stands:
<PRE><TT>CALL FZOUT (LUN,IXDIV,LHEAD,0,'DI',2,NUH,IUHEAD)</TT></PRE>
<P>
Occasionally the d/s to be written out is not described
as easily as assumed above,
for example one may want to write a data-structure
minus some of its sub-structures.
In this case (see section <A HREF=chapter2_1.html#secFZmarking>8.21</A>) the user may pre-mark
the banks to be output and
<PRE><TT>CALL FZOUT (LUN,IXDIV,LHEAD,0,'M',2,NUH,IUHEAD)</TT></PRE>
Output of a file must be terminated,
to make sure that the last physical record is transfered
from the buffer to the file, for example with:
<PRE><TT>CALL FZENDO (LUN,'I')</TT></PRE>
to re-read the file just written; or with:
<PRE><TT>CALL FZENDO (LUN,'TX')</TT></PRE>
if the program no longer needs this file.
<P>
The recommended procedure is to have a standard job-termination
routine, called <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ3/chapter2_1.html#ZEND>ZEND</A>,
normally called from the Main program.
This routine is called also from the ZEBRA recovery system in case
of abnormal job termination.
Into this routine one should include a
<PRE><TT>CALL FZENDO (0,'TX')</TT></PRE>
to terminate all pending output files.
However, this call pulls in the non-negligible volume of code
for the <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> complex, and should hence be present only
for programs really using <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>.
<P>
Writing several different files to the same logical unit
can be done in complete analogy to the case of reading;
in the examples given above one has to add the 'O' option
for <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>,
and one has to change the calls to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZENDI>FZENDI</A> into calls to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZENDO>FZENDO</A>.

<P>
for exchange file format it is important to choose a good value for
all one's files, and then stick to it.
One has to compromise between conflicting things:
on tapes one would like to make this large,
but this costs memory for the Zebra buffer,
multiplied by the number of files concurrently open,
and it wastes disk space for end-of-run records which occupy
a whole physical record.
Some numbers can be found in chapter <A HREF=#secH1FZformatspecs><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
The physical record size for the exchange file format needs to be
specified both to Zebra with <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A> and to the system with the OPEN
statement and maybe even with some JCL,
in which case the user may need to know this:
the block size is specified to Zebra in words, the default is 900 words.
These words correspond to words in the Zebra dynamic store,
such that a bank of 900 words could just fill one block.
Except for 32-bit machines,
the number of bits written to the file for each word depends
on the data format: for the exchange data format each word
generates 32 bits, for the native data format a full machine word
is transferred.
To the system the block size has to be specified either in bytes
or in native words.
For example, on the CRAY (64-bit words) the record-size of
a standard block will have to be given as 7200 bytes
(900 machine words) for the native data format,
but as 3600 bytes (450 machine words) for the exchange data format.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0014400000000000000> medium M or C:</A></H2>
<P>
for the media 'memory' and 'channel' the Exchange File Format
is implied, and this cannot be changed.
The Native Data Format can be selected by giving the <tt>N</tt> option.
Instructions on the use of these media is given in separate
sections near the end of this chapter.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0014500000000000000> medium A:</A></H2>
<P>
Alfa mode should only be used to transmit data over a network
connection which cannot handle binary file transfers.
The character representation (ASCII, EBCDIC, etc) used
is that of the originating machine;
the translation is expected to happen in the network station.
Alfa mode must not be used for writing magnetic tapes,
it is at least a factor of ten slower than binary.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0014600000000000000> medium D:</A></H2>
<P>
this serves two different purposes:
on some machines Fortran is not capable of handling
fixed-length records without system control words in sequential mode,
only in direct-access mode, but this only for disk files.
A side-effect advantage is better error recovery from lost records
on files which have been moved from tape to disk.
No timing studies have yet been made to check whether direct access
is slower than sequential acccess.
<P>
The other purpose is random access to the d/ss on the file,
this is described in section <A HREF=chapter2_1.html#secrandomaccess>8.18</A> 
``Usage for random access''.
Selecting D only gives the possibility, but no obligation for
random access: for input Zebra will read the file sequentially
except at moments when the user interfers with calls to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZINXT>FZINXT</A>;
for output Zebra operates strictly sequentially.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0014700000000000000> medium T:</A></H2>
<P>
at the moment no distinction is made internally in Zebra between
disk and tape files (exception: NORD),
but it may turn out that the C interface will have to have
a separate branch for tape files on some machines.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0014800000000000000> usage F or Y:</A></H2>
<P>
read/write with Fortran, option F, is the default if none of Y, L, K
are specified.
Exception IBM: up to including Zebra version 3.66 the default
for sequental files is Y, that is handling with IOPACK;
from version 3.67 onwards the default will be F.
Most people give now (version 3.65) option F,
those who really want IOPACK should change their programs to
request Y to be insensitive to the transition to 3.67.
The only other machine sensitive to Y is presently the NORD:
magnetic tapes must be written through the MAGTAP utility,
on this machine TX implies Y.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION0014900000000000000> usage L:</A></H2>
<P>
read/write is with the routines <A HREF=#CFGET>CFGET</A>/<A HREF=#CFPUT>CFPUT</A> which are part of the
interface to the C Library for handling files with fixed-length records.
This mode must be used for exchange file format tape files on those
Unix machines where Fortran does not provide the parameter
<tt>RECORDTYPE='FIXED'</tt> (or equivalent) in the OPEN statement,
like the Sun, or SGI, or DecStation.
On the same machines one might use this also for disk files as
an alternative to option D; no studies have yet been made to
see which is faster.
L can be combined with D for random access using the C interface.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00141000000000000000> usage K:</A></H2>
<P>
this is a hook to enable a user to write his own handling of physical
records in case that none of the modes provided are satisfactory.
Chapter <A HREF=#secH1FZthecnicaldetails><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> gives some hints of how to do this.
<P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00141200000000000000> data-format:</A></H2>
<P>
for native file format this is 'native';
for exchange file format data format 'exchange' is assumed by default,
but native data format can be requested by giving the N option.
In this case LREC native words are written for each physical record,
and no data translation, packing, or byte inversion, is done.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00141300000000000000> direction:</A></H2>
<P>
the option <tt>IO</tt> is needed in two separate cases:
   - if the program first writes a new file which it then reads;
   - if the program positions an existing file by reading
     for further output.
In this case the input or output mode of the file is defined
by the first I/O action on the file;
it can be changed at the end of the first phase only with <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZENDI>FZENDI</A>
from input to output, or with <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZENDO>FZENDO</A> the other way round.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00141400000000000000> various S:</A></H2>
<P>
for the exchange file format,
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> normally places the start of a given d/s just after
the end of the previous structure in the same physical record,
to economize file space.
This may be inconvenient if the file is later to be handled
by means other than calling <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>: giving the <tt>S</tt> option
will force each d/s to start on a new physical record.
For the medium 'memory' the <tt>S</tt> option is implied.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00141500000000000000> various U:</A></H2>
<P>
only for media 'memory' and 'channel':
When handling the physical records for the Data Format 'exchange'
it may be more convenient for the user to do himself the
unpacking (<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>) or packing (<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>) operation needed,
because in this case he has immediate access to the control
information in the records.
(Note: on the VAX 'packing/unpacking' is in fact byte inversion.)
The <tt>U</tt> option allows this:
if given, <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> delivers the data non-packed,
and <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> expects data which have already been unpacked by the user.

giving this option suppresses message printing for this file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00141800000000000000> NEOF:</A></H2>
<P>
this parameter controls for output
the explicit writing of system file-marks;
for input it controls the interpretation of a system file-mark,
which can mean either end-of-file or end-of-data
(two file-marks in succession always act as end-of-data).
On most machines the default value is NEOF=0,
meaning single-file files only.
This can be over-ridden by giving the 1, 2, or 3 option
if multi-file files must be handled.

<P>
The reason for this facility is the fact that detecting 'end-of-tape'
is a problem which cannot be solved satisfactorily in full
generality.
To help the user who wants control over tape reel switching,
ZEBRA counts the total number of words written,
and checks after every data-structure written out
(but not for start-of-run, end-of-run, end-of-file)
whether the limit has been reached.
If so, it returns the 'pseudo end-of-tape' condition (cf. <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>)
for every data-structure output until an increase of the limit
to include one more reel of tape is requested with <tt>ALIMIT=0</tt>.
Thus the user can switch tape,
call <tt><A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZLIMI>FZLIMI</A> (LUN,0.)</tt>,
and continue to write another tape,
again waiting for the 'end-of-tape' signal.

<P>
To read the next data-structure one calls <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>.
The return code in IQUEST(1) will tell the caller whether
the READ operation was free of error, and whether the
object read was a d/s, a start-of-run, an end-of-run,
or an end-of-file signal.
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> may be asked to skip to and then read the next start-of-event
d/s or the next start-of-run record.
<P>
In the simplest case (opt = '.' or blank) <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> will read the next
data-structure into the division indicated by the parameter <tt>IXDIV</tt>,
at the same time delivering the user-header vector to <tt>IUHEAD</tt>.
<P>
The selective read has been provided to rapidly skip unwanted
d/ss without expansion into memory and without relocation
of the links:
calling <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> with opt='S' causes reading of the next pilot
information only,
returning to the user the header-vector (and the text-vector, if any)
for taking a decision to read or to skip the 'pending d/s'.
Skipping is done by asking for the next d/s;
accepting is done by calling <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> with opt='A'.
Note that every call to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> has to be checked for the success of
the operation by testing on <tt>IQUEST(1)</tt>.
<P>
In the cases described so far the complete data-structure is
read and is deposited into one particular division.
It is however possible to steer individual data segments of
the d/s into particular divisions, or to cause them to be ignored.
This can be done by using the options <tt>T</tt> and <tt>D</tt>,
as described separately in the next paragraph.

be careful about the meaning of status codes 4 and 5:
'4' means EoF seen on a file which can be a multi-file file;

<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00113000000000000000> FZIN - read one data-structure by segments</A></H1>
<P>
It may be convenient to represent an event by several separate
d/ss on the file.
This permits in an easy way to selectively read only a particular
part of every event.
This method has one draw-back:
if there are reference links pointing from one part to an other part
of the event, where both parts are residing simultaneously in
memory, and if the two parts are written out by two separate calls to
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>, the cross links will be lost on read-back.
<P>
To amend for this, the following scheme has been implemented:
when a data-structure is transferred from several divisions to the
FZ file, the data are 'segmented', i.e. a table is included
into the pilot information, indicating the divisions from which
the different data segments originated, together with their sizes.
On read-back the user can either skip particular data-segments or
he can direct data-segments into particular divisions individually.
<P>
To do so, three calls to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> are necessary:
<OL><LI> call with the S option to read the pilot;
  <LI> call with the T option to ready the segment table in /FZCSEG/;
  <LI> call with the D option to read the d/s with distribution.
</OL>The second call will present the 'segment table' to the caller
in the labelled Common Block
<PRE><TT>COMMON /FZCSEG/ NQSEG,IQSEGH(2,20),IQSEGD(22)    where:

           NQSEG  = number of segments contained in the pending d/s
                             if NQSEG = 0:  d/s is not segmented
      IQSEGH(1,J) = char 1-4
      IQSEGH(2,J) =      5-8  of the Hollerith name of the division
                              from which segment J derives
       IQSEGD(J)    index of division selected for segment J

      Note: IQSEGD(21+22) are working elements of the system and,
             like NQSEG, must not be modified by the user.</TT></PRE>
To direct segment <tt>J</tt> into a given division one should set
<tt>IQSEGD(J)</tt> to the index of that division
(or merely to the division number;
the store is selected by the parameter <tt>IXDIV</tt> to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>).
To cause this segment to be ignored <tt>IQSEGD(J) = -1</tt> should be set.
<tt>IQSEGD(J)</tt> containing zero directs this segment into the
'default' division selected by the parameter <tt>IXDIV</tt> to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>.
(The vector <tt>IQSEGD</tt> is preset to zero by <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>.)
<P>
Since <tt>/FZCSEG/</tt> is used for segment handling with all streams,
both input and output, there must not occur some other call
to FZ for any stream between the second and the third call.
Also, having called with the <tt>T</tt> option does not oblige the user
to follow it by a call with the <tt>D</tt> option;
he may call with the <tt>A</tt> or even the <tt>S</tt> option,
in which cases the segment table is simply ignored.

<P>
<A NAME=secrandomaccess><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A>
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00118100000000000000> Principles</A></H2>
<P>
For random access the location of a d/s within its file is specified
by its 'data-structure address', the DsA, consisting of 2 words:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>word 1
<DD> number of the physical record in which the d/s starts;
<DT>word 2
<DD> off-set within this record.
</DL>If the file contains less than 2 Gigawords you can pack this into
one word with:
<P>
<PRE><TT>JDSAP = (JDSA1-1) * LREC  + JDSA2</TT></PRE>
where <tt>LREC</tt> is the number of words in each physical record, as specified
to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>.
<P>
For every successful call to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> or <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> Zebra returns the DsA
of the latest d/s in <tt>IQUEST(5)</tt> and <tt>IQUEST(6)</tt>,
provided the file-format is 'exchange' and even for a tape file.
To prepare a file for reading it randomly the user would construct
a table, the 'direct access table', or DaT, which contains the
relevant properties of the d/ss on the file plus their DsA's.
This can be done either by an extra read pass over the file
to collect the data, or more economically at the time when the
file is created.
In the latter case the DaT can be written to the file as
the last d/s before end-of-file,
and is then ready for use for any future reading of the file.
<P>
When reading a file initialized with mode D given to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>,
repeated calls to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> will read the data sequentially.
To obtain a particular data-structure one has to call <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZINXT>FZINXT</A> specifying
the DsA of the wanted d/s; this will reset the 'current read point'
for the file and the next call to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> will then deliver the wanted d/s.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00118200000000000000> File creation</A></H2>
<P>
Do this:
<OL><LI> call <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A> with <tt>CHOPT = 'DO'</tt> or <tt>'LDO'</tt> for a disk file, or
      <tt>CHOPT = 'TO'</tt> or <tt>'TLO'</tt> for a tape file.
<LI> lift a bank, generously large enough to hold the DaT.
<LI> <tt>CALL FZODAT (LUN,0,0)</tt>  to create the
      'DaT forward-reference record'.
      This is a small record to provide 2 words to hold the DsA of the DaT
      itself; they are initialized to zero and on the final call <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZODAT>FZODAT</A> will
      try to update them with the true address if the file is ready for
      random access.
      This should be provided on every file which later one may want
      to access randomly, like a tape file to be copied to disk.
      This is useful only if this record is the very first record on the file.
<LI> create the file by repeated calls to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>,
      compiling at the same the Direct Acces Table,
      including into it <tt>IQUEST(5)</tt> and <tt>(6)</tt> returned from <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>.
<LI> call <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ1/chapter2_1.html#MZPUSH>MZPUSH</A> to reduce the bank holding the DaT to the size
      actually needed.
<LI> <tt>CALL FZODAT (LUN,IXDIV,LBANK)</tt>  to store the bank with the DaT
      onto the file and to update the forward reference record if possible;
      Zebra will remember the DsA of this d/s in the control-bank for this file.
<LI> <tt>CALL FZENDO (LUN,'TX')</tt>  to terminate and close the file.
      This will store the DsA of the DaT bank into the user header of
      the special Zebra EoF record, which is the very last item on the file.
</OL><H2><A NAME=SECTION00118300000000000000> Reading the file</A></H2>
<P>
Do this:
<P>
1) call <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A> with <tt>CHOPT = 'D'</tt> or <tt>'LD'</tt> to permit random access.
<P>
2) retrieve the direct-access table:
<PRE><TT>CALL FZIDAT (LUN,IXDIV,LDAT,1)
        IF (IQUEST(1).NE.0)             GO TO trouble</TT></PRE>
    This will try to find the Direct access Table:
<OL><LI> first it will read the first record on the file to see whether
      it is a DaT forward reference record containing a non-zero DsA.
      If so it will use this adr to read the DaT and deliver it to the user.
<LI> if this is not successful it will try to get from the operating
      system the length of the file and then read its last physical record;
      this should contain the Zebra EoF record with the DsA of the DaT.
<LI> if this fails it will scan either the last 24 physical records
      or the whole file for the DaT record, depending on whether
      it did or did not get some indication of the file size.
</OL>3) to get a wanted d/s: find it in the DaT, get its DsA
and call <tt><A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZINXT>FZINXT</A> (LUN,MDS1,MDS2)</tt>,
with <tt>MDS</tt> the 2-word data-structure address.
This resets the read point, calling <tt><A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> (LUN,...)</tt> will then
deliver the wanted d/s.
<P>
If acccess to the table was not immediate,
FZIDAT will try to update the forward reference record, if it exists,
to ease future use.
It can do this only if the file hase been opened for read/write,
and this has to be signalled by giving CHOPT='DIO' to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>.
<P>
Keeping the DaT on the file to be read is obviously the simplest
way to proceed, but other organisations are possible.
For example, if one has a large disk with many files as the
data-base for the events of an experiment,
one may want to have a separate global DaT
for all the events on the disk,
with a structure reflecting the files and holding their names.
<P>
Remember: if one needs a data-base with key-word access
or update capability one should use the RZ package of Zebra.

<P>
<A NAME=secFZMEMO><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A>
<P>
In this mode all the records assembled by <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> to represent
one particular data-structure are placed one after the other
contiguously into an area of memory belonging to the user
(rather than being written to a file).
One is then free to move the data around,
normally from a machine which has no I/O facilities
to a machine which has, as in emulator farms.
They may there be written to tape.
Eventually the data will be brought back to be read with <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>,
either directly from a file, or again from user memory.
To 'read' a d/s from user memory,
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> expects all the records representing the d/s
to be present in the memory area.
<P>
FZ handles the medium 'memory' only with the
<b>file format</b> 'exchange',
ie. with logical 'records' blocked onto fixed-length physical
'records'.
The <b>data format</b> can be 'exchange' or 'native'.
<P>
The details of this format are found in chapter <A HREF=#secH1FZformatspecs><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
To use this mode the following is necessary:
<UL><LI> the 'stream' must be initialized with the <tt>M</tt> 
      option in <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>,
<LI> the options <tt>I</tt> or <tt>O</tt> 
      set this stream for input or output
      (it cannot be used for both concurrently),
<LI> the parameter <tt>LUN</tt> to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A> identifies the stream,
<LI> the <tt>N</tt> option selects the native data format,
<LI> the <tt>U</tt> option selects unpacked mode, as explained below;
<LI> the user memory to be used for this stream
      has to be connected by calling <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZMEMO>FZMEMO</A>;
      different streams may use different memory regions.
</UL>The connection call is
<P>
<P> CALL FZMEMO (LUN,MBUF,NWBUF)<P>
<P>
indicating to FZ the where-abouts and the size of one's
memory region for stream LUN.
NWBUF gives the size in terms of machine words,
it must be large enough to hold the largest d/s to be handled;
see the memory-size considerations further down.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00119100000000000000> Output</A></H2>
<P>
In the case of output one calls <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> (also <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZRUN>FZRUN</A>),
on return one will find the physical records representing
the d/s in one's memory.
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> starts this string of records with a 'steering block',
ie. a physical record with 8 control words
(see chapter <A HREF=#secH1FZformatspecs><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> for details),
placed at the start of the user's memory;
the remaining data are placed as 'fast blocks', if any.
The last block is normally used only partially,
the unused part is marked out with a padding record,
ie. a logical record of type 5,
of which only the record length and the type code are significant,
the data contents are irrelevant.
<P>
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> returns in <tt>IQUEST(9)</tt> the number of useful machine words
stored into the memory.
It includes the (normally) 2 control words of the padding record,
but not its data words.
If one needs it,
one can compute the number of physical records
as  <tt>1 + (IQUEST(9)-1)/LENREC</tt>  where <tt>LENREC</tt>
is the physical record size in machine words.
On machines with a word-size greater than 32 bits this needs
a little care,
as explained in the note about <tt>LREC</tt> in section <A HREF=chapter2_1.html#secFZFILE>8.4</A>
for <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>,
and also below.
<P>
To obtain a start-of-run record one can call <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZRUN>FZRUN</A>
to get it into the memory, the useful size is again found
in <tt>IQUEST(9)</tt>.
To get an end-of-run record one has to call <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZRUN>FZRUN</A> explicitly;
one may call <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZENDO>FZENDO</A> to have the file statistic printed,
but this will not put anything into the user's memory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00119200000000000000> Input</A></H2>
<P>
To read back a d/s originally produced by <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>
and then shipped around,
one has to store it in the user memory,
connected with <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZMEMO>FZMEMO</A>,
and call <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>.
This will transfer the data to the dynamic store,
converted if the Exchange Data Format is in use,
and relocate the links.
The user's memory is left intact.
<tt>IQUEST(1)</tt> returns the read status and must be checked after
every call to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00119300000000000000> Lay-out of the memory and size considerations</A></H2>
<P>
Using the information of chapter <A HREF=#secH1FZformatspecs><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>,
one obtains the lay-out of the d/s in the memory
produced by <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> as shown on the next page.
NWPHR is the physical record length as defined by the call
to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>, it is 900 by default.
<P>
If one is using the native data format
(or if one is running on a machine where the native format
is identical to the exchange format, ie. on IEEE machines
such as Apollo, Alliant, Motorola)
this lay-out applies literally,
the numbers are usable directly,
and <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> will return <tt>IQUEST(9)=NWUSE</tt>.
<P>
However, if one is using the exchange data format
the data are converted to their exchange representation,
and they are also 'packed'.
For example, on the Cray two words are packed into one
machine word,
and <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> will return <tt>IQUEST(9)=(NWUSE+1)/2</tt>.
On a VAX 'packing' means byte inversion,
so also in this case the data are not usable directly.
<P>
Use of the <tt>U</tt> option:
the situation can arise that one needs the exchange format,
because communication is between different machines,
but that one also needs access to the control information
at the beginning of the data.
One could gain this access by local unpacking, but this is messy.
It is more elegant to take charge of the packing oneself,
and instruct <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> to deliver the data non-packed
(by selecting the U option in <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>).
In this case the lay-out shown on the next page
applies again literally, or almost:
the data are delivered as one word per each machine word
(and on the VAX the bytes are not yet inverted),
but they are converted to the exchange representation,
32 bits right justified with zero-fill.
This conversion affects negative integers, floating point numbers,
Hollerith, but not positive integers and bit patterns.
Since the control information has been deliberately chosen
to be of this invariant kind, it remains usable.
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> returns again <tt>IQUEST(9)=NWUSE</tt>.
When shipping the data one has to execute the 'packing' operation
applicable on the given machine such that they arrive in
the correct form at the destination.
<P>
From these considerations one easily derives the size
requirement on the memory to be connected with <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZMEMO>FZMEMO</A>.
On the Cray for example, to handle data-strutures of not more
than 80000 words (including the control and context information)
one needs a memory region of 40000 words if one operates
in normal exchange mode,
but 80000 words for native mode or if the <tt>U</tt> option is selected.

<P>
In this mode the records assembled by <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> are channelled
through a user routine one-by-one to their destination;
(rather than being written to a file or to memory).
Similiarly for <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> the data are acquired not
from tape or disk directly, but through the same user routine.
The name of this routine is not decided by Zebra.
<P>
Channelled mode operates with
<b>file format</b> 'exchange',
ie. the data are collected into fixed-length records,
and each record is handed to the user routine when complete
(for <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>, the inverse for <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A>).

      in the previous paragraph;
<LI> the user routine <tt>UserSR</tt> to be used for this stream

<P>
<A NAME=secFZmarking><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://asis01.cern.ch/CN/CERNTEX/icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A>
<P>
Normally the identification of the banks belonging to the
data-structure to be written out is left to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> itself.
Naturally this can cover only logically simple cases,
such as the complete d/s supported by the bank at the
entry address specified to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>.
<P>
The situation does however arise that one needs a more
complex description.
For this the M option has been provided which tells <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>
that the user has already marked the banks to be transfered
by setting system status-bit <tt>IQMARK (=26)</tt>,
and that he has designated the memory interval which contains
his banks by storing the addresses of the lowest and the highest
bank into the <tt>COMMON/ZLIMIT/LLOW,LHIGH</tt>.
Thus in principle one can set up one's selection in full
generality,
except that one must take care that the banks marked
actually form a connected d/s with the entry address <tt>LENTRY</tt>.
<P>
It may however be quite tedious to do this job completely
'by hand'.
So one tries to provide some tools for formalizable situations.
At present the only such tool is <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ2/chapter2_1.html#MZMARK>MZMARK</A>,
which scans a d/s for marking,
but at the start of every new linear structure reached during
the scan it checks the Hollerith ID of the start bank
with a list to see whether the new sub-structure should
be included into the marking process.
<P>
To take an example, suppose the header bank at <tt>LENTRY</tt>
supports 4 primary sub-structures with bank names
<tt>RAW</tt>, <tt>GEOM</tt>, <tt>KIN</tt>, <tt>DST</tt>, of which the first 3 support in turn
4 sub-structures with bank names <tt>TEC</tt>, <tt>BGO</tt>, <tt>CAL</tt>, <tt>MUC</tt>,
and at the even lower levels there may be any unspecified further
sub-structures.
<P>
If now one wants to write out only the data for <tt>GEOM</tt>, <tt>KIN</tt>, <tt>DST</tt>,
and for the first 2 only the <tt>BGO</tt> results,
one can do this with
<P>
<PRE><TT>PARAMETER  (NID=4)
      DIMENSION  IDLIST(NID)
      DATA       IDLIST  /  4HRAW , 4HTEC  , 4HCAL , 4HMUC  /

      CALL MZMARK (0,LENTRY,'-',NID,IDLIST)
      CALL FZOUT (LUN,0,LENTRY,IEVENT,'M',IOCH,NUH,IUHEAD)</TT></PRE>
<P>
Note that we have used the anti-selection option (<tt>-</tt>) of <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBMZ2/chapter2_1.html#MZMARK>MZMARK</A>
to veto at the high levels,
which permits the low level linear stuctures to be accepted without
one having to specify which exactly they are.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00122000000000000000> Suppress loading of unused parts of FZ</A></H1>
<P>
Because the format for processing an FZ file
(native, exchange, ALFA mode)
is selected by the initializing call to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZFILE>FZFILE</A>,
and because the handling of all formats is done
by the one set of routines <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> and <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>,
the user's call to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZIN>FZIN</A> or to <A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A> causes the loading
of all the code to handle all the formats.
This volume is non-negligible,
and for production programs one may want to suppress
loading of the non-used parts of it.
This can be done by adapting this dummy routine,
which as it stands is valid for a program which only
reads files in native mode and which does not call
<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZOUT>FZOUT</A>/<A HREF=../../zebra/ZEBFZ2/chapter2_1.html#FZENDO>FZENDO</A>:
