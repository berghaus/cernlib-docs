    sequential access and a Fortran unformatted read is issued, using the
    IBM extension NUM=nbytes, e.g.

All other systems plus VAX/VMS systems using C I/O. The record length is
determined from the data in the file itself. For this reason, the RZ
package must know if the file is in native or exchange format. For this
reason, the option 'X' is recommended when processing exchange format
files.
