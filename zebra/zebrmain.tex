\section*{About this guide}
\par This user guide contains a description of the basic
ZEBRA routines. The
calling sequences which an ``average user'
will need in most of his work are treated in
detail. Programmers who are
responsible for the layout of the basic software in their experiment
and those who
have to know more about the internal conventions used by ZEBRA
will want to consult the ZEBRA reference manual.
The latter explains the
philosophy behind each ZEBRA construct, discusses each user routine
giving its full calling sequence with
a list of possible error return codes and detailed examples.
It discusses exception handling and provides a description
of the layout of the system tables and banks.
\section*{Acknowledgements}
\par The authors would like to thank all their colleagues, who by their
continuous interest and encouragement, have given them the
necessary input to provide a modern system which, they hope, will allow
an easy development of the basic software
in high energy physics and related fields.
\par In particular
M.Goossens acted as editor of the present guide and he wrote the code
of the DZ package, while
M.Metcalf reviewed the entire document and
is the main author of the introductory chapter.
