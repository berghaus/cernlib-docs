\section*{Preliminary remarks}
This Reference Guide for the ZEBRA RZ system consists of three parts:
\begin{OL}
\item An overview of the system.
\item A reference section with a description of each routine.
\item An appendix with details on system dependencies and 
technical implementation aspects.
\end{OL}

Examples are in {\tt monotype face} and strings to be input by the user 
are {\tt\underline{underlined}}.
In the index the page where a routine is defined is in {\bf bold},
page numbers where a routine is referenced are in normal type.

This document has been produced using \LaTeX~\cite{bib-LATEX}
with the {\tt CERNMAN} style option, developed at CERN.
