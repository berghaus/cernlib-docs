1 <A NAME=SETUP10> SETUP</A>
 The SETUP command should always be used to mount magnetic tapes,
 rather than the standard VMS MOUNT command.
 SETUP command will ALLOCATE a tape drive, MOUNT the tape
 and perform volume-label checking. The tape is then re-mounted via a
 standard VMS mount command and made available for user-processing.
 In addition to the qualifiers presented below, any MOUNT qualifers
 may be used. See HELP MOUNT for further information on additional
 qualifiers.
 N.B. SETUP has been installed with the TMS option on this node.
 The correct device and label information from the TMS and the
 qualifiers /GENERIC, /LABEL should NOT be specified.
 Format:
      SETUP [(volume-label|VSN)] [(visual-identifier|VID)] [(logical-name)]
2 Parameters
 (volume-label|VSN)
  Specifies the MAGNETICALLY recorded label on the volume.
  Labels can have from 1 through 6 characters. This is the
  equivalent of the IBM MVS volume serial name (VSN) on the DD statement.
  The volume-label parameter is  always required. If your tape is unlabelled,
  specify the same value as the visual-identifier.
  N.B. if the VSN is in lower or mixed case, it must be enclosed in
  double quotes.
 (visual-identifier|VID)
  Specifies the contents of the sticky label on the volume reel itself.
  VID's must be exactly 6 characters.
  The visual-identifier must be a CERN tape number (5 digits followed
  be a check letter), an experimental tape number, (1 or 2 characters
  followed by 5 or 4 digits) or an XIN/XUT number.
  XIN tapes are read only.
  The visual-identifier parameter is  always required.
 logical-name[:]
  Defines a 1- through  63-alphanumeric  character  string  logical
  name to be associated with the device allocated.
  The logical name must be used to reference the drive on which the
  tape is mounted.
  If you do not specify a logical name, the SETUP  command  assigns
  the  default  logical  name  TAPE$volume-label.
2 Qualifiers
/BACKUP
 If you specify /BACKUP, your tape will be mounted /FOREIGN, after
 SETUP has verified that the correct volume-label has been specified.
 Use this qualifier to read and write tapes in BACKUP format, in
 addition to the relevant /LABEL qualifier.
/DEBUG
 This qualifer requires SYSPRV and is primarily of use for debugging
 new versions of the SETUP command. If specified, extra debug information
 will be displayed during command processing.
/FOREIGN
 Use of this qualifier requires VOLPRO or BYPASS privilege.
 Without privilege, tapes may only be mounted /FOREIGN if the
 /BACKUP qualifier is specified, together with the correct
 /LABEL qualifier and value. See the description of the /BACKUP
 and /LABEL qualifiers and the examples section for more details.
 If you do not know the magnetic label of a tape, use the LABELDUMP
 command to determine it.
/WAIT
   /WAIT     (Default in BATCH)
   /NOWAIT   (Default otherwise)
  This parameter controls whether SETUP will exit if all tape drives
  are currently in use, or wait until one becomes free. If executing
  in BATCH mode, /WAIT is in effect unless explicitly negated.
/WRITE
   /WRITE
   /NOWRITE  (D)
 Controls   whether  the  volume  can  be  written.   /NOWRITE  is
 equivalent to write-locking the device.
2 Mounting_FOREIGN_tapes
On the CERN Computer Centre VAXcluster,tapes do not normally need
to be mounted /FOREIGN. The exception is for processing with BACKUP.
To mount a tape for processing by BACKUP (or any other program that
requires the tape to be mounted /FOREIGN), use
SETUP/BACKUP.
Note that you MUST specify the correct volume-label, if any.
2 Examples
Setup a tape for read only.
$ .....
$ SETUP MX1015 MX1015             ! If the SETUP fails, the job will exit.
$ ASSIGN TAPE$MX1015 FOR001
$ RUN DSTANAL
$ EXIT
Setup a tape for write
$ ON ERROR THEN GOTO ABEND        ! Protect against problems with SETUP etc.
$ SETUP/NOWRITE/WRITE 939927 XIN112 MYDRIVE
$ ASSIGN MYDRIVE:  FOR001         ! Processing of data sets is up to user.
$ RUN PROG
$ EXIT
$ !
$ABEND:
$ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "Program abended"
$ EXIT
Mount a labelled tape for writing to with BACKUP.
$SETUP/WRITE/BACKUP MICRO PR9902
Mount a tape written on a data acquisition VAX
blocksize = 3600 bytes and recordsize = 3600 bytes.
$SETUP/BLOCK=3600/RECORD=3600 MC1009 MC1009
$! Skip past volume label to logical file 1
$SET MAGTAPE/SKIP=FILES:1 TAPE$MC1009
$RUN MYPROG ! Uses EPIO, reading from unit 1.
