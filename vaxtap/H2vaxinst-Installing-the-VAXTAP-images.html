<P>
The VAXTAP-TMS interface consists of two parts. The first part, selected
by the PATCHY flag TMS, obtains information such as the label type and
device type from the TMS. If this option is selected, then the /LABEL and
/GENERIC qualifiers should not be specified. If the are specified, the
information must match that obtained from the TMS. This can be overridden
for users in the list defined by the logical name SETUPGENERIC.
<P>
In addition, the flag TMSMOUNT selects code which will record mounts in
the TMS. If you have selected the TMSMOUNT option, then all images, with
the exception of EINIT, must be installed with SYSPRV privilege. This is
to permit the programs to communicate correctly with the TMS system.
<P>
An example of such an installation is shown below.

In addition, the STAGE executable must be installed with SYSLCK privilege.
This is required whether a TMS interface exists or not. SYSLCK is used to
communicate with the process that cleans up the staging disk.
