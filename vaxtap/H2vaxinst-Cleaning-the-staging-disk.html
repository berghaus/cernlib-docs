<P>
When a stage command is issued, the stage program checks to see how much
space exists on the staging disk. If there is insufficient space, it
signals a cleanup process and waits until enough space has been freed.
<P>
This cleanup process should be permanently running and is started by
running the STAGECLN command file, e.g. at system startup.
<P>
The STAGECLN program takes out a lock on a resource named STAGEPURGER. It
establishes a blocking AST routine which is fired whenever a user issues a
STAGE command that requires more disk space than is currently available on
the staging disk.
<P>
The program then spawns a subprocess which then executes the command file
CLEANSTAGE.COM. This command file performs the following actions.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Illegal files are deleted from the staging disk
<LI>It then deletes files older than a specified time.
<LI>If enough space is recovered, it exist, otherwise the lifetime is
decreased and the process repeated.
</OL>
<P>
There are a number of parameters that can be set to control the action of
this command file. These are shown below.

$ !
$ !    The following settings are for VXCERN...
$ !
$      days     = "7"      ! Start by deleting files older than DAYS days
$      hours    = "23"     ! then switch to hours when DAYS < 1
$      max_pass = 15       ! Maximum number of passes
$ !
$ !    Deletion is done on creation date. To delete according to
$ !    file usage do:
$ !
$ !    SET VOLUME/RETENTION=(1,1-) DISK$STAGE
$ !
$ !    This means that, when files are created, the expiry date is set
$ !    to now plus one day. On each access, 1 hour is added to the current
$ !    time. If this is greater than the current expiry date then the expiry
$ !    date is reset.
$ !
$ !    Then, change DELETE/CREATED/SINCE to
$ !                 DELETE/EXPIRED/BEFORE
$ !    which deletes files whose expiry date is BEFORE the specified
$ !    date & time
