<P>
Remote staging is currently only available through the FATMEN <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-FATMEN>[bib-FATMEN]</A> package. However, the
implementation requires the creation of special batch queues, definition
of logical names and other configuration details which are best described
here. The technique used to provide remote staging requires no
modification to VAXTAP.
<P>
Remote staging is possible in two cases:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The remote tape drive is attached to a VAX in the same VAXcluster as
the client
<LI>The remote tape drive is attached to a VAX that is in not in the same
VAXcluster
</OL>
<P>
On the client machine, a file SETUPEXE:TPSERV.CONF must be created. This
file contains a list of generic device names and the nodes on which they
are served.
<P>

When a remote stage is required, a batch job will be submitted to a
special queue on that node. If the server node is in the same VAXcluster
as the client, the batch job is submitted directly. In other cases, DECnet
task to task is used to start a server to submit the job and check its
status.
<P>
<H3>Configuring the batch queues</H3>
<P>
A generic batch queue is required for each generic device type that is to
be served. If the queue is to be used to stage devices of type 8200, then
the queue name must be STAGE8200S. A physical queue fed by this generic
queue must be created on each node that is to serve devices of this type.
The job limit should be set to the number of devices that are concurrently
available for this type of operation. Thus, if one has two devices of type
8200 that are dedicated to staging, the job limit should be set to 2.
<P>
<H3>Log files from the batch jobs</H3>
<P>
The log files from the staging jobs are written to the directory defined
by the system logical name STAGELOGS.
<P>
<H3>Accessing the staging disk</H3>
<P>
It is assumed that the staging disk is DFS mounted on the client machine.
<P>
<H3>Installing the stage server</H3>
<P>
On server systems which are not in the same VAXcluster as prospective
clients, a small stage server must be built and defined as a DECnet
object.

automatically extracted as part of the FATMEN installation procedure.
