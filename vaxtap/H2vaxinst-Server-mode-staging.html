The STAGE command is normally typed interactively, or is issued as part of
a command file. An additional possibility exists, which is particularly
useful in the case of multi-file tapes. This is server mode staging, where
stage requests are written to a special directory and processed from
there. Server mode staging requires a further logical name definition,
namely STAGEQUEUE, which should point to a directory that can be written
to by users for whom server mode staging is permitted. Typically this will
be handled by the use of a rights identifier.
<P>
If disk quotas are enabled on the volume to which the logical name
STAGEQUEUE points, then the directory must be set up as in the example
below:
<P>
<PRE>
(IDENTIFIER=owner,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE+DELETE+CONTROL)
(IDENTIFIER=stageuser,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE)
(IDENTIFIER=owner,OPTIONS=DEFAULT,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE+DELETE+CONTROL)
(IDENTIFIER=stageuser,OPTIONS=DEFAULT,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE)
</PRE>
<P>
where owner is the owner of the directory, with a corresponding disk quota
entry and stageuser the rights identifier that permits access to this
directory.
<P>
If disk quotas are not enabled on the volume in question, then allowing
group or world write access to the directory is sufficient.
<P>
Server mode stage requests consist of a file whose name identifies the
volume and file to be staged. The file name corresponds to the normal
naming convention, i.e. vsnvid.fseq-labeltype. The contents of the file
are ignored, but it can be useful to record the origin of the stage
request. In the case of requests issued from FATMEN, the file contains the
line
<P>
<PRE>
Stage request for vsnvid.fseq-labeltype issued at yymmdd hhmm by user on node nodename
</PRE>
<P>
If the STAGEQUEUE logical name is defined, then an existing staging
process for the volume in question will automatically satisfy any requests
in the queue. This is done as follows:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The STAGE command checks whether the logical name STAGEQUEUE is
defined
<LI>If so, server mode staging is automatically enabled
<LI>It then positions the tape to each file in turn and looks to see if
there are any requests for the file in question.
<LI>If so, the request is processed and the request file deleted
<LI>If not, the tape is positioned to the next file
<LI>Requests are always processed by increasing file sequence number. If
required, the tape will be rewound and a further pass made to satisfy new
requests
</OL>
<P>
The logic to decide when to launch a new staging process is embodied into
the FATMEN package and is transparent to the user.
