1 <A NAME=XTAPE14> XTAPE</A>
  Use the XTAPE command to examine the labels of a tape and optionally
  dump blocks from the specified number of files.
   Format:
   XTAPE [(visual identifier)]
2 Parameters
  (visual identifier)
  Specifies the number of the tape on the tape reel itself.
  If you do not specify this parameter, you are prompted for it.
2 Qualifiers
/BLOCKS
   /BLOCKS=1 (D)
  Use this qualifier to specify how many blocks from each file are to be
  dumped.
/FILES
   /FILES=1 (D)
 Use this qualifier to specify how many files are to be dumped.
/GENERIC
   /GENERIC=TA90 (D)
 N.B. if XDUMP has been installed with the TMS option,
 as is the case on VXCERN, XDUMP will obtain the correct
 device information from the TMS and /GENERIC should NOT be specified.
 Use this qualifier to instruct XDUMP to allocate a certain
 device type. If not specified, the generic device will default to
 TA90 - the IBM 3480 compatible drive.
 The generic devices available on your system are defined by the system
 manager as logical names, e.g. SETUP_TA90S, SETUP_TA78S.
/DEBUG
 This qualifer requires SYSPRV and is primarily of use for debugging
 new versions of the XTAPE command. If specified, extra debug information
 will be displayed during command processing.
/WAIT
   /WAIT     (Default in BATCH)
   /NOWAIT   (Default otherwise)
  This parameter controls whether LABELDUMP will exit if all tape drives
  are currently in use, or wait until one becomes free. If executing
  in BATCH mode, /WAIT is in effect unless explicitly negated.
