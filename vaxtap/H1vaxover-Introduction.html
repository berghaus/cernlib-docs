The utilities described in this manual were originally developed for the
CERN VAXcluster VXCERN.
<P>
Several essential features were felt to be missing from standard VAX tape
handling utlities. The most important of these were
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Support for IBM SL tape labels
<LI>Support for visual identifiers (VIDs)
<LI>Efficient device allocation
</UL>
<P>
To this end, a new utility was written, known as SETUP. This command,
which uses standard VAX/VMS system services, performs device allocation,
tape mounting and label checking.
<P>
This command was soon joined by the other utilities described in this
manual, namely LABELDUMP, STAGE, TAPECOPY, WRTAPE and XTAPE.
<P>
An interface to the CERN Tape Management System exists, and is activated
at installation time as described in the installation chapter of this
manual.
<P>
In addition, and interface from the FATMEN File and Tape Management system
is also provided. Further details can be found in the FATMEN manual <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-FATMEN>[bib-FATMEN]</A>.
<P>
Originally, the commands described in this manual were defined using the
DCL SET COMMAND utility. However, they have recently been rewritten so
that this is no longer required, using the techniques described in <A
HREF=H1Bibliography.html#bib-NOCLD>[bib-NOCLD]</A>.
