<P>
One may enable multi-file staging using the logical name STAGEFULLTAPE.
This name should point to a list of generic device types for which
multi-file staging is to be enabled. When a stage request is issued for a
tape of the appropriate type, all files are automatically staged.
<P>
This can be useful to prevent multiple mount requests for the same volume.
