  Use the WRTAPE command to copy a disk file to tape, writing EBCDIC
  or ASCII tape labels, depending on the currently labeltype as defined
  in the Tape Management System (TMS). Type
  SYSREQ TMS QVOL vid
  to display the current labeltype (SL=labels encoded in EBCDIC, (IBM format)
                                    AL=labels encoded in ASCII,  (VAX format)
                                    NL=no labels).
  WRTAPE is essentially the same as STAGE/OUT except that it allows any
  existing file to be specified, using the /INFILE qualifier.
  For all other qualifiers, see the description of the STAGE /OUTPUT command.
2 Examples
WRTAPE/INFILE=MYDATA.DAT JDS001 CUT123 /NAME=DELPHI/NUMBER=3
The above command writes file MYDATA.DAT to file 3 of the tape with VID CUT123.
The file name to be written on the tape is DELPHI.
