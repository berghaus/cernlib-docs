\notHTML{\section*{Preliminary remarks}}

This {\bf Complete Reference} of
the FATMEN system (for \textbf{F}ile \textbf{a}nd
\textbf{T}ape \textbf{M}anagement: \textbf{E}xperimental
\textbf{N}eeds), consists of four parts:
\begin{OL}
\item An \textbf{overview} of the system.
\item A \textbf{step by step} tutorial introduction.
\item A \textbf{user guide}, describing each command in detail.
\item An \textbf{installation and management guide}.
\end{OL}

The FATMEN system is implemented on various mainframes and personal
workstations. In particular versions exist for IBM~VM/CMS, IBM~MVS,
VAX/VMS and various Unix-like platforms, such as APOLLO, HP/UX, Cray Unicos,
Ultrix, IBM RS6000, Silicon Graphics and SUN.

are {\tt\underline{underlined}}}}

\section*{Acknowledgements}

The FATMEN package has undergone continuous evolution since its
first introduction in 1989. During this time many people   
have contributed to the system,
through discussions or by providing code and assistance.

The FATMEN system depends upon a number of other packages, such
as the Tape Management System and numerous tape staging subsystems.
The help of the authors and maintainers of such systems is 
gratefully acknowledged.

This document has been produced using \LaTeX~\cite{bib-LATEX}
with the \Lit{cernman} style option, developed at CERN. 
A compressed PostScript file \Lit{fatmen.ps.gz}, 
containing a complete printable version
of this manual, can be obtained from any CERN machine
by anonymous ftp as follows
(commands to be typed by the user are underlined)\footnote{%
If your site does not carry the gnu \Lit{gzip} utility you can get the
uncompressed file by dropping the \Lit{.gz} suffix from the
\Ucom{get} command, and also skipping the \Ucom{binary}
specification below.}:
