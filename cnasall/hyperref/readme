This package is used to emend cross-referencing commands in LaTeX
to produce some sort of \special commands;
there are backends so far for the \special set defined for HyperTeX
dvi processors, for embedded pdfmark commands for processing by Acrobat
Distiller, for dviwindo, and for pdfTeX.

Included are:

  a) (backref) a package by David Carlisle to provide links back from 
     bibliography to the main text; these are hypertext links after using
     hyperref.
  b)  (nameref) a package to allow reference to the *names* of sections rather
     than their numbers.

The only packages which I suspect will cause problems are those
who play with bibliographical citations, including the following:

achemso.sty
aguplus.cls
aguplus.sty
chapterbib.sty
drftcite.sty
prabib.sty

I will try to make these work in due course.
