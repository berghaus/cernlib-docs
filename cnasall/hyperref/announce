I have made a new release (5.0) of my package `hyperref' on CTAN
(macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref). Thanks to David Carlisle
for a good many cleanups of the internals (including making the use of
.toc and .aux files from non-hyperref runs work), and to Berthold Horn
for stimulating the rearrangement of the pdfmark code to make
dvipsone work.

hyperref is a LaTeX package which aims to redefine all
cross-referencing commands and overload them with \special commands
which can be used in hypertext products. Package options are available
to tailor the code for the following drivers:

 [hypertex] The conventions of the HyperTeX project
 [dvips]    Acrobat "pdfmark" commands for Acrobat Distiller (using dvips)
 [dvipsone] Acrobat "pdfmark" commands for Acrobat Distiller (using dvipsone)
 [dviwindo] Y&Y Windows dvi  viewer
 [pdftex]   Han The Thanh's TeX variant which writes PDF direct
 [dvipdf]   Sergey Lesenko's dvi to pdf program

Drivers for TrueTeX and Textures will be added later, possibly.
Any volunteers?

(`pdfmark' and `nativepdf' are aliases for `dvips')

Indexing and `back-referencing' work, as do arbitrary point
to point links, and network URLs.

There are problems remaining to be fixed one day in understanding and
coping with *all* the bibliography packages out there (but you should
use natbib, its excellent)

And of course finding better ways to avoid the fragility of
overloading some low-level LaTeX code which could change at any time
would be a good thing.
