   This is the menu for my own commands 


From  /MYMENU/...

 1:   MYCMD         This is the first sentence of the first paragraph.  The HELP menus 
                    show the first phrase of the first paragraph.  The phrase finishes 
                    at the first line ending with a '.' which is only now.
