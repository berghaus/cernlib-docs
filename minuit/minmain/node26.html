Additional Trouble-shooting</A>

<P>
When Minuit just doesn't work, some of the more common causes are:

<P>

<UL><LI><B>Precision mismatch.</B>
      Make sure your <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="3852"></A> has been compiled with the same precision as the
      version of Minuit you are using.
      When using <TT>DOUBLE PRECISION</TT>, it is safest to use the <TT>IMPLICIT</TT>
      declaration to make sure that everything is <TT>DOUBLE PRECISION</TT>, not
      just the arguments of <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="3855"></A> but also the internal variables.
      Note that depending on the computer system used, floating-point
      constants may be passed as single precision in subroutine arguments,
      even if there is an <TT>IMPLICIT DOUBLE PRECISION</TT> statement
      (which is strictly speaking correct since the <TT>IMPLICIT</TT> statement
      refers only to variables, not constants).
      Therefore, if constants are used as arguments in subroutine calls,
      they must be explicitly of the right precision (for example, on Apollo,
      even 0. is not equal to <TT>0.D0</TT>).
       
      If the problem is only one of precision, and not of word length mismatch,
      an appropriate <TT>SET EPS</TT><A NAME="3858"></A> command may fix it.

<LI><B>Trivial bugs in <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="3861"></A>.</B>
      The possibilities for Fortran bugs are numerous. Probably the most
      common among physicists inexperienced in Fortran is the confusion
      between <TT>REAL</TT> and <TT>INTEGER</TT> types, 
      which you can sometimes get away with, but not always.
      [For example, if <TT>A</TT> and <TT>B</TT> are <TT>REAL</TT> variables, 
      the Fortran statement <TT>A = 2*B</TT>   is not good programming, 
      but happens to do what the user
      probably intended, whereas the statement   <TT>A = B + 2/3</TT>   almost
      certainly will not do what the user intended.]
      Minuit can spot some trivial bugs itself, and issues
      a warning when it detects an unusual <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="3864"></A> behaviour.  Such a warning
      should be taken seriously.
       
      Minuit also offers some tools (especially <TT>SCAN</TT><A NAME="3867"></A>) 
      which can help the user to find trivial bugs.

<LI><B>Overwriting in a user routine.</B>
      Overwriting most often occurs when setting the values of a local
      array or an array in <TT>COMMON</TT>, and elements outside the
      dimensions of the array are addressed.
      Most computer systems do not detect this error unless you attempt to
      write into a protected area of memory, and of course Minuit is also
      helpless, especially if Minuit itself is being overwritten.
      The symptoms of user overwriting may be almost anything,
      including unusual behaviour of Minuit itself.
      The effects depend critically on where instructions and data are
      loaded in memory, so they may change completely if the same
      program is recompiled with different compiler options or reloaded
      in a different sequence, even though the compiler and loader
      are not at fault.

<LI><B>Changing the values of input arguments.</B>
      In subroutine <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="3870"></A>, for example, the arguments <TT>NPAR</TT> and <TT>IFLAG</TT>,
      as well as the values of the parameters themselves, are only
      input to <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="3873"></A> and their values should not be changed inside <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="3876"></A>.
      Minuit is now protected against this in principle, since
      the user only gets a copy of the value, not the actual address
      of the internal Minuit variable, but still this is a symptom of
      misunderstanding by the user.
       
      If you really want to change the number of variable parameters,
      this must be done with commands like <TT>FIX</TT><A NAME="3879"></A> and <TT>RELEASE</TT><A NAME="3882"></A>, 
      by redefining parameters using command <TT>PARAMETER</TT><A NAME="3885"></A>
      or <TT>CLEAR</TT><A NAME="3888"></A>.
       
      Similarly, if a parameter takes on an unwanted value, it will do no good
      to change its value inside <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="3891"></A>: In the best case, 
      Minuit won't see your
      improved value, and in the worst case, it will produce unpredictable
      results. To set a parameter to a certain value, use the command
      <TT>SET PARam</TT><A NAME="3894"></A>, and to keep it within certain bounds, use the command
      <TT>SET LIMits</TT><A NAME="3897"></A>.  If the parameter must obey more complicated constraints,
      you must find a trick such as adding a penalty value to <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="3900"></A> outside
      of the physical region, to force it back to where you want it.

<LI><B>An ill-posed problem.</B>
      For questions of parameter dependence, see the discussion above
      on postive-definiteness.
      Other mathematical problems which can arise are:
      <B>excessive numerical roundoff</B> --
      be especially careful of exponential and factorial functions
      which get big very quickly and lose accuracy;
      <B>starting too far from the solution</B> --
      the function may have unphysical local minima, especially
      at infinity in some variables;
      <B>incorrect normalization</B> --
      in likelihood functions, the probability distributions must
      be normalized or at least have an integral which is independent
      of the values of the variable parameters.

<LI><B>A bug in Minuit.</B>
      This is extremely unlikely, but it did happen once. If a bug is suspected, and
      all other possible causes can be eliminated, please try to save a copy of the
      input and output files, listing of <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="3903"></A>, and other information that may be
      relevant, and send them to <TT>Fred.James@cern.ch</TT>.
