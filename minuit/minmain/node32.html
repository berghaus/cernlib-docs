Non-linearities: MIGRAD versus HESSE versus MINOS
</H1>

<P>
In the theory of statistics, one can show that in the asymptotic
limit, any of several methods of determining parameter errors are
equivalent and will give the same result.  Let us for the moment call
these methods <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4491"></A>, <TT>HESSE</TT><A NAME="4494"></A>, and
<TT>MINOS</TT><A NAME="4497"></A> (<TT>SIMPLEX</TT><A NAME="4500"></A> is a special case).  It
turns out that the conditlons under which these methods yield exactly
the same errors are either of the following:
 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The model to be fitted (<I>y</I> or <I>f</I>) is exactly a linear function of the 
fit parameters <I>a</I>, or
<DT>2.
<DD>The amount of observed data is infinite.
</DL>
 
It may happen that (1) is  satisfied, in whlch case you don't really 
need Minuit, a smaller, simpler, and faster program would do, since 
a linear problem can be solved directly without iterations (see [<A
 HREF="node34.html#bib-EADIE">5</A>],
p. 163-165), for example with CERN library program <TT>LSQQR</TT>. 
Nevertheless, it may be convenient to use Minuit slnce non-linear 
terms can then be added later if desired, without major changes to 
the method. Condition (2) is of course never satisfied, although in 
practice it often happens that there is enough data to make the 
problem ``almost linear'', that is there is so much data that the 
range of parameters allowed by the data becomes very small, and 
any physical function behaves linearly over a small enough region.
 
The following sections explain the dirrerences between the various 
parameter errors given by Minuit.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00921000000000000000">
Errors printed by Minuit</A>
</H2>
 
The errors printed by Minuit at any given stage represent the best 
symmetric error estimates available at that stage, which may not 
be very good. For example, at the first entry to <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="4503"></A>, the user's step 
slzes are given, and these may bear no resemblance at all to proper 
parameter errors, although they are supposed to be order-of-magnltude estimates. 
After crude minimizers like <TT>SEEK</TT><A NAME="4506"></A> or <TT>SIMPLEX</TT><A NAME="4509"></A>, 
a revised error estimate may be given, but this too is only meant to
be an order-or-magnitude estimate, and must certainly not be 
taken seriously as a physical result. Such numbers are mainly for 
the internal use of Minuit, which must after all assume a step size 
for future minimizations and derivative calculations, and uses these 
``errors'' as a first guess to be modified on the basis of experience.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00922000000000000000">
Errors after MIGRAD (or MINIMIZE)</A>
</H2>
 
The minimizing technique currently implemented in <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4512"></A> is a 
stable variation (the ``switching'' method) of the 
Davidon-Fletcher-Powell variable-metric algorithm.
This algorithm converges to the correct error matrix as it converges 
to the function minimum. 

<P>
This algorithm requires at each step a ``working approximation'' of the
error matrix, and a rather good approximation to the gradient vector at
the current best point. 
The starting approximation to the error matrix may be obtained in different
ways, depending on the status of the error matrix before MIGRAD is called
as well as the value of STRATEGY.  Usually it is found to be advantageous 
to evaluate the error matrix rather carefully at the start point in order
to avoid premature convergence, but in principle even the unit matrix
can be used as a starting approximation.  
Usually the Minuit default is to start by calculating the full error matrix by
calculating all the second derivatives and inverting the matrix.
If the user wants to make sure this is done, he can call HESSE before MIGRAD.

<P>
If a unit matrix is taken to start,
then the first step will be in a <EM>steepest descent</EM> direction, which is
not bad, but the estimate of EDM, needed to judge convergence, will be poor.
At each successive step, the information gathered from the change of gradient
is used to improve the approximation to the error matrix, without the need
to calculate any second derivatives or invert any matrices.
The algorithm used for this <EM>updating</EM> is supposed to be the best known,
but if there are a lot of highly correlated parameters, it may take many steps
before the off-diagonal elements of the error matrix approach the correct values.

<P>
In practice, <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4515"></A> usually yields good estimates of the 
error matrix, but it is not absolutely reliable for two reasons:
 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Convergence to the minimum may occur ``too fast'' for <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4518"></A> to 
have a good estimate of the error matrix. In the most flagrant of 
      such cases, <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4521"></A> realizes this and automatically introduces an 
      additional call to <TT>HESSE</TT><A NAME="4524"></A> (described below), informing the user that 
      the covariance matrix is being recalculated. Since, for <I>n</I> variable 
      parameters, there are <I>n</I>(<I>n</I>+1)/2 elements in the error matrix, the 
      number of <TT>FCN</TT><A NAME="4527"></A> calls from <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4530"></A> must be large compared with 
      <I>n</I><SUP>2</SUP> in order for the <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4533"></A> error matrix calculation to be 
      reliable.
<DT>2.
<DD><TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4536"></A> gathers information about the error matrix as it 
      proceeds, based on function values calculated away from the 
      minimum and assuming that the error matrix is nearly constant as a 
      function of the parameters, as it would be if the problem were 
      nearly linear. If the problem is highly non-linear, the error matrix 
      will depend strongly on the parameters, <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4539"></A> will converge more 
      slowly, and the resulting error matrix will at best represent some 
      average over the last part of the trajectory in parameter-space 
      traversed by <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4542"></A>.
</DL>
 
If <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4545"></A> errors are wrong because of (1),
<TT>HESSE</TT><A NAME="4548"></A> should be commanded after <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4551"></A> 
and will give the correct errors. If <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4554"></A> 
errors are wrong because of (2), <TT>HESSE</TT><A NAME="4557"></A> will help, but only in an 
academic sense, since in this case the error matrix is not the whole 
story and for proper error calculation <TT>MINOS</TT><A NAME="4560"></A> must be used.
 
As a general rule, anyone seriously interested in the parameter 
errors should always put at least a <TT>HESSE</TT><A NAME="4563"></A> command after each 
<TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4566"></A> (or <TT>MINIMIZE</TT><A NAME="4569"></A>) command.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00923000000000000000">
Errors after HESSE</A>
</H2>
 
<TT>HESSE</TT><A NAME="4572"></A> simply calculates the full second-derivative matrix by finite 
differences and inverts it. It therefore calculates the error matrix 
at the point where it happens to be when it is called. If the error 
matrix is not positive-definite, diagnostics are printed, and an 
<A NAME="4345"></A>
attempt is made to form a positive-definite approximation. The 
error matrix must be positive-definite at the solution (minimum) 
for any real physical problem. It may well not be positive away from 
the minimum, but most algorithms including the <TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4575"></A> algorithm 
require a positive-definite ``working matrix''.
 
The error matrix produced by <TT>HESSE</TT><A NAME="4578"></A> is used to calculate what Minuit 
prints as the parameter errors, which therefore contain the effects 
due to parameter correlations. The extent of the two-by-two 
correlations can be seen from the correlation coefficients printed by 
Minuit, and the global correlations (see [<A
 HREF="node34.html#bib-EADIE">5</A>], p. 23) are also 
printed. All of these correlation coefficients must be less than one 
in absolute value. If any of them are very close to one or minus one, 
this indicates an illposed problem with more free parameters than 
can be determined by the model and the data.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00924000000000000000">
Errors by MINOS</A>
</H2>
 
<TT>MINOS</TT><A NAME="4581"></A> is designed to calculate the correct errors in all cases, 
especially when there are non-linearities as described above. The 
theory behind the method is described in [<A
 HREF="node34.html#bib-EADIE">5</A>], pp. 204-205 
(where ``non-parabolic likelihood'' should of course read 
``non-parabolic log-likelihood'', 
which is equivalent to ``nonparabolic chi-square'').
 
<TT>MINOS</TT><A NAME="4584"></A> actually follows the function out from the minimum to find 
where it crosses the function value (minimum + <TT>UP</TT>), instead of using 
the curvature at the minimum and assuming a parabolic shape. This 
method not only yields errors which may be different from those of 
<TT>HESSE</TT><A NAME="4587"></A>, but in general also different positive and negative errors 
(asymmetric error interval). Indeed the most frequent result for 
most physical problems is that the (symmetric) <TT>HESSE</TT><A NAME="4590"></A> error lies 
between the positive and negative errors of <TT>MINOS</TT><A NAME="4593"></A>. The difference 
between these three numbers is one measure of the non-linearity of 
the problem (or rather of its formulation).
 
In practice, <TT>MINOS</TT><A NAME="4596"></A> errors usually turn out to be close to, or 
somewhat larger than errors derived from the error matrix, although 
in cases of very bad behaviour (very little data or ill-posed model) 
anything can happen. In particular, it is often not
true in <TT>MINOS</TT><A NAME="4599"></A> that two-standard-deviation errors 
(<TT>UP=4</TT>) and three-standard-deviation  errors (<TT>UP=9</TT>) 
are respectively two and three times as big as one-standard-deviation errors, 
as is true by definition for errors derived from the 
error matrix (<TT>MIGRAD</TT><A NAME="4602"></A> or <TT>HESSE</TT><A NAME="4605"></A>).
