%$%  Revision 1.5  92/08/11  23:13:12  sdc
%$%  Fixed a bug which caused an problem with captions that contained 
%$%  expressions like \sqrt;  This was pointed out by Tom Scavo
%$%  (scavo@cie.uoregon.edu).  A separate bug was fixed which caused
%$%  different sized captions to be misaligned;  This problem was
%$%  pointed out by Simon Marshall (S.Marshal@Hull.ac.uk).  Also
%$%  cleaned up the code a mite and *changed* the figure spacing so that
%$%  if no optional section is given, then the figure is only followed
%$%  by \subfigbottomskip and not that plus (\subfigcapskip + \strut
%$%  height).  This should make it easier to adjust spacing as desired.
%$%  
%$%  Revision 1.4  92/06/27  10:40:34  sdc
%$%  Added a hack to allow the \label command to be used within the
%$%  body of the subfigure giving a reference label in the form
%$%  \arabic{thefigure}\thesubfigure.  Added standard file header for
%$%  style. 
%$%  
%$%  Revision 1.3  90/10/22  17:04:28  cochran
%$%  Changed test for empty caption inside of \@subfigure to compare
%$%  tokens and not the caption vs. \@empty.  The former (incorrect)
%$%  test caused an error when the first two letters of the caption
%$%  were the same.
%$%
%$%  Revision 1.2  89/08/30  07:18:29  cochran
%$%  Added a separate bottom margin and expanded the comments.

%$% Usage:  \documentstyle[...,subfigure,...]{...}
%$%
%$%             \subfigure[CAPTIONtext]{FIGUREbox}
%%%
%%% Creates a subfigure box with an optional CAPTION under a FIGURE.
%%% The FIGURE is centered with \subfigtopskip of vertical space added
%%% above.  If there is a CAPTION, then \subfigcapskip vertical space
%%% is added below the FIGURE followed by the CAPTION.  Finally, 
%%% \subfigbottomskip of vertical space added at the bottom.
%%%
%%% If a CAPTION is given (including a null CAPTION `[]') then the
%%% subfigure is labeled with a counter formatted by the macro
%%% `\thesubfigure' which returns `(a)', `(b)', etc.  If desired,
%%% this macro may be redefined.  The counter used for labeling the
%%% subfigures is `subfigure' and is incremented for each subfigure
%%% regardless of whether a CAPTION was printed.
%%%
%%% One example of use is to surround the figure in a tabular
%%% environment (this preserves alignment along the bottom of the
%%% figures when the figures and/or the captions are different
%%% heights):
