This directory contains the LaTeX style files, which are considered
"non-standard" and which are used by some of the TeX files for the
CNAS manuals in the other directories below tex.dir.

If you find other styles, which are not in this directory, they can 
be found in the /usr/local/lib/tex/macros directory on asis01.
