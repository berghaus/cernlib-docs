\Cernhead {Machine-Independent Uniform Random Numbers}
{\tt RN32} generates random numbers uniformly distributed in the
interval (0,1). It produces exactly the same {\tt REAL} numbers on all
computers of word length at least 32 bits. On CDC, the lower 28 bits are
always zero. The generator is of the usual multiplicative congruential
type with a 'good' multiplier (69069). It gives good results for short
sequences but is not recommended for delicate calculations involving
more than $10^6$ random numbers.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprogram  \\
User Entry Names: \Rdef {RN32}, \Rdef{RN32IN}, \Rdef{RN32OT}\\
External References: \Rind{IAND} (M441)
\Usage
The generator {\tt RN32} does not require initialisation, but it can be
started or restarted with a given 'seed' if desired.
\begin{verbatim}
    X = RN32(DUMMY)
\end{verbatim}
generates a random number {\tt X} of type {\tt REAL}.
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL RN32IN(IX)
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt IX} (type {\tt INTEGER}) must be an odd integer of at least 5
decimal digits, $\mathtt{\leq 21474836647}$, sets a starting seed equal
to {\tt IX}.
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL RN32OT(IX)
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt IX} where of type {\tt INTEGER}, returns the current value of
the seed in {\tt IX}.
\Method
The default value of the starting seed is {\tt 65539}.
The multiplicative congruential method is used to generate a series of
31-bit integers by multiplying the previous integer by {\tt 69069} and
keeping only the lower 31 bits. This is then converted to a {\tt REAL}
number by first masking off the lower 8 bits to assure that the
conversion can be done exactly on a machine with 32-bit word length,
floating the resulting integer and multiplying by the float of $2^{-31}$.
