\Cernhead {Source Code Maintenance}
{\tt PATCHY} and the associated auxiliary programs serve in development,
maintenance, and inter-computer transport of source programs. Suitably
structured source files containing several versions of a given program
permit code selection and code modification (down to
single-statement-level) by simple control cards to {\tt YPATCHY}.
Compacting and structuring of card files for efficiency {\tt (YTOBIN)},
maintenance of compacted files at the deck level {\tt (YEDIT)},
creation of machine-independent, transportable files {\tt (YTOCETA)} and
listing of compacted files {\tt (YLIST)} and others are simple auxiliary
operations in this environment.
\Structure
Complete programs; executable modules exist on all machines at CERN
where the CERN Program Library is installed, normally in the directory
{\tt /cern/pro/bin}. \\
