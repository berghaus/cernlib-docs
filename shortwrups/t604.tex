\Cernhead {Solution of Poisson's or Laplace's Equation in
Two-Dimensional Regions}
The {\tt POISCR} program package consists of a set of programs designed
for the solution of Poisson's or Laplace's equation in two-dimensional
regions. The programs have originally been written to solve
magnetostatic problems, but they can equally well be used for other
potential problems. Material properties may be linear or non-linear.
Polarized material (like permanent magnet material) is allowed.

\Source
A program {\tt POISSON} was originally written by R.F. Holsinger then
working at LBL. It was based on an earlier program {\tt TRIM} by A.
Winslow and on theoretical work by K. Halbach (LBL). The CERN Program
Library version {\tt POISCR} is a revision of these programs by C.
Iselin (CERN).
