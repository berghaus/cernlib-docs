\Cernhead{Find Compatible Node-Nets in an Incompatibility Graph}
{\tt GRAPH} finds all compatible sets of events (nodes) in an
incompatibility graph (in which incompatible events or nodes are
connected). It is useful, for example, in track-matching programs
for eliminating spurious tracks.
\par
On each call, one compatible node-set is returned. The user may
decide in the first call whether the solutions should be evaluated over
the whole graph or subgraph by subgraph.
Indications on "end-of-graph" and, if applicable, "end-of-subgraph"
are given.
