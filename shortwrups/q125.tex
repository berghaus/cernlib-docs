\Cernhead {Object Oriented Data Manager}        
The {\tt DSPACK} package is a set of Fortran and C callable routines
and utilities.
{\tt DSPACK} provides Object-Oriented data management for Fortran
and C programs. The aim of the package is to enable users to map
C and Fortran structures into common memory, accessible by other
programs. Handling of objects uses classes, messages and methods.
All objects are defined and accessible by name at run-time.
Object-Oriented I/O is a part of the system.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprograms and command line shell.
\Usage
See {\bf Long Write-up}.
