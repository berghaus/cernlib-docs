\Cernhead {Elliptic Partial Differential Equation}
{\tt EPDE1} solves an elliptic partial differential equation of
general form
(Poisson's equation being a special case) over a two-dimensional region
using a finite difference method. The region may be of any shape and
on its boundary either the dependent variable or a relation involving its
derivative may be specified.
