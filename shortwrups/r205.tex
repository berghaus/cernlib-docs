\Cernhead {REDUCE 3.3 - A System for Symbolic Algebra}
The capabilities of {\tt REDUCE} version 3.3 include:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Expansion and ordering of polynomials and rational functions;
\item  Symbolic differentiation;
\item  Substitution and pattern matching in a wide variety of forms;
\item  Automatic and user controlled simplification of expressions;
\item  Calculations with symbolic matrices;
\item  Factorization of polynomials;
\item  Arbitrary floating-point precision arithmetic;
\item  Facilities for defining new functions and extending program
       syntax;
\item  Analytic differentiation and integration;
\item  Non-commutative algebra;
\item  Calculations of interest to high energy physicists, including
        Dirac gamma matrices, spin 1/2 and spin 1 algebra;
\item  A complete language for symbolic calculations, in which
       the {\tt REDUCE} program itself is written.
\item  Output in Fortran-compatible form to be used for numerical
       calculations.
\end{itemize}
