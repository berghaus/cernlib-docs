\Cernhead {KUIP - Kit for a User Interface Package}
The {\tt KUIP} package is part of {\tt PAW} (Q121)
(Physics Analysis Workstation), but can be used independently.
{\tt KUIP} is an interface program for any application
based on interactive input of commands.
From the application it is seen as a slave which supplies the
next command with its associated parameters.
It takes care of program input in various (e.g., graphics or menu) forms
and performs preliminary checking on command syntax and parameters.
