\Cernhead {PAW - Physics Analysis Workstation Package}
{\tt PAW} is a program package to assist physicists in the analysis and
presentation of their data. It provides interactive graphical
presentation and statistical or mathematical analysis, working on
objects familiar to physicists like histograms, event files ($n$-tuples)
and vectors.
\par
The {\tt PAW++} program provides a Motif interface to {\tt PAW}.
\Structure
Interactive data analysis program.
\Usage
See {\bf Long write-up}.
\Notes
The packages involved in the implementation of {\tt PAW} and the
platform availability are described in the {\bf Reference Manual}.
