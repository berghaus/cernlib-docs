{\bf OBSOLETE}

Please note that this routine has been obsoleted in CNL 219. Users are
advised not to use it any longer and to replace it in older programs.
No maintenance for it will take place and it will eventually disappear.

Suggested replacement: None }}
\end{center}
The standard input and output I/O-facilities available to IBM
Fortran programs contain a number of deficiencies. In particular,
only data sets which have a record format of {\tt VS} or {\tt VBS} can
be processed without the use of a {\tt FORMAT} statement. If a data set
is not of this type one must resort either to time-consuming formatted
I/O or to the use of special-purpose subprograms. {\tt IOPACK} attempts
to overcome the deficiencies by providing a set of subprograms for
reading, writing and manipulating data sets.
\par
The subprograms can process sequential data sets or members of
partitioned data sets on any type of device and one may refer to several
streams concurrently. Facilities are also provided for the specification
of {\tt DD} statements during program execution.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprograms \\
