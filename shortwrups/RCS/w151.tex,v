\Cernhead {Beam Transport Simulation, Including Decay}
{\tt TURTLE} is designed to simulate charged particle beam transport
systems. It allows evaluation of the effects of aberrations in beams
with a  {\it small phase space volume}. These include higher-order
chromatic aberrations, non-linearities in magnetic fields and
higher-order geometric aberrations due to the accumulation of
second-order effects. The beam at any point in the system may be
represented by one- or two-dimensional histograms. {\tt TURTLE} also
provides a simulation of decay of pions or kaons into muons and
neutrinos.
\par
{\tt TURTLE} uses the same input format as {\tt TRSPRT} (W150). An input
stream set up for {\tt TRSPRT} can thus be used for {\tt TURTLE} with
only a few additions.
