\Cernhead {Pack Bytes into Full Words}
{\tt BUNCH} converts a source array containing {\tt NBYTES} bytes of
{\tt NBITS} bits per byte (where each byte is stored right-adjusted in a
full word), into a target array in which the bytes follow each other
contiguously without intermediate padding. The last word of the target
array, if incomplete, is however padded with binary zero. {\tt BUNCH}
is the inverse of {\tt BLOW} (M426).
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprogram \\
User Entry Names: \Rdef{BUNCH} \\
External References: \Rind{PKCHAR}{M427}\\
\Usage
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL BUNCH(SOURCE,TARGET,NBYTES,NBITS)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{DLtt}{12345678}
\item[SOURCE] Source array containing {\tt NBYTES} bytes, each
right-adjusted in a full word.
\item [TARGET] Target array, which must be at least
$\mathtt{NBYTES*NBITS/nbpw}$ (rounded up to an integral value) words
long, where $\mathtt{nbpw=60}$ on CDC and $\mathtt{nbpw=32}$ on IBM.
\item [NBYTES] Number of bytes in the source array $(\mathtt{NBYTES>0})$.
\item [NBITS] Number of bits per byte $\mathtt{(0 < NBITS \leq nbpw)}$.
\end{DLtt}
\Restrict
The arrays {\tt SOURCE} and {\tt TARGET} must not overlap in any way.
\Errorh
{\tt BUNCH} ignores calls with erroneous parameter values.
\Examples
IBM:
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL BUNCH(SOURCE,TARGET,200,16)
\end{verbatim}
The array {\tt SOURCE} contains 200 words, each containing an 16-bit
byte, right-adjusted. After returning from {\tt BUNCH}, the array
{\tt TARGET} will contain 100 32-bit words, in which the 200 16-bit
bytes are stored contiguously.
