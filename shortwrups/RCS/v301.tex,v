\Cernhead {Copy an Array}
These routines copy a continuous string of words into a
continuous set of locations.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprograms \\
User Entry Names: \Rdef{UCOPY}, \Rdef{UCOPIV}, \Rdef{UCOPYN},
\Rdef{UCOPY2}, \Rdef{USWOP} \\

only)
\Usage
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL UCOPY(A,X,N)
\end{verbatim}
copies {\tt N} words from {\tt A} into {\tt X};
the beginning of {\tt A} may overlap the end of {\tt X}.
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL UCOPY2(A,X,N)
\end{verbatim}
copies {\tt N} words from {\tt A} into {\tt X},
any overlap is allowed.
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL UCOPYN(IA,IX,N)
\end{verbatim}
transfers into {\tt IX} the negative values of {\tt N} integer words
from {\tt IA};
the beginning of {\tt IA} may overlap the end of {\tt IX}.
(For numbers of type {\tt REAL}, use {\tt VCOPYN} (F121).)
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL UCOPIV(A,X,N)
\end{verbatim}
copies {\tt N} words from {\tt A} into {\tt X}, in reverse order,
i.e. $\mathtt{X(1)=A(N),\ldots,X(N)=A(1)}$. No overlapping is allowed.
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL USWOP(A,B,N)
\end{verbatim}
exchanges the first $\mathtt{N \geq 0}$ words of arrays {\tt A} and
{\tt B}. {\tt A} and {\tt B} must not overlap. \\[4mm]
For $\mathtt{N=0}$ the above routines act as 'do-nothing'.
