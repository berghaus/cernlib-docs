{\bf OBSOLETE}
\end{center}
Please note that this routine has been obsoleted in CNL 219. Users are
advised not to use it any longer and to replace it in older programs.
No maintenance for it will take place and it will eventually disappear.

Suggested replacement: None }}
\end{center}
{\tt TRTCH} consists of a series of general purpose routines which
will translate strings of any length according to the requested
translation table.
{\tt TRTCH} is mostly IBM only, however, the translations
between {\tt ASCII} and {\tt EBCDIC} are also available for VAX.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprogram \\
User Entry Names: \Rdef{TRA0E0}, \Rdef{TRC0E0}, \Rdef{TRE0A0},
\Rdef{TRE0C0}, \Rdef{TRE0EL}, \Rdef{TRE0EU}, \Rdef{TRE0TN},
\Rdef{TRE0ZT}
\Usage
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL TRicoc(array,nlen)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{DLtt}{12345678}
\item [ic] Input character code (see table below).
\item [oc] Output character code (see table below).
\item [array] String of characters to be translated,
each character occupying one 8-bit byte.
\item [nlen] Number of characters to be translated.
\end{DLtt}
For character codes of $< 8$ bits, such as CDC display code,
right-justification with zero-fill is assumed. \\[3mm]
The character codes available are:
\begin{DLtt}{123456}
\item [A0] CERN standard {\tt ASCII},
\item [C0] CDC display code, as used at CERN,
\item [E0] CERN standard {\tt EBCDIC},
\item [EL] {\tt EBCDIC} with upper case letters converted to lower case,
\item [EU] {\tt EBCDIC} with lower case letters converted to upper case,
\item [TN] {\tt EBCDIC} with blanks for characters not on {\tt TN} train,
\item [ZT] {\tt EBCDIC} with dots, {\tt '.'}, for characters not on
{\tt TN} train.
\end{DLtt}
The available translation routines are:
\begin{DLtt}{12345678}
\item [TRA0E0] Standard {\tt ASCII} to standard {\tt EBCDIC}.
\item [TRC0E0] CDC display code to standard {\tt EBCDIC}.
\item [TRE0A0] Standard {\tt EBCDIC} to standard {\tt ASCII}.
\item [TRE0C0] Standard {\tt EBCDIC} to CDC display code.
\item [TRE0EL] Standard {\tt EBCDIC} to lower case only {\tt EBCDIC}.
\item [TRE0EU] Standard {\tt EBCDIC} to upper case only {\tt EBCDIC}.
\item [TRE0TN] Standard {\tt EBCDIC} to {\tt TN} train {\tt EBCDIC}.
\item [TRE0ZT] Standard {\tt EBCDIC} to {\tt TN} train {\tt EBCDIC}
with {\tt '.'}--fill.
\end{DLtt}
\Notes
The {\tt TN} train is the print train used by the IBM impact
printer. It contains upper and lower case characters and
a few unusual special characters such as boxes and numeric
superscripts.
