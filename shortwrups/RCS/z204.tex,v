{\bf OBSOLETE}
\end{center}
Please note that this routine has been obsoleted in CNL 219. Users are
advised not to use it any longer and to replace it in older programs.
No maintenance for it will take place and it will eventually disappear.

Suggested replacement: None }}
\end{center}
{\tt FNBLAN, FNZERO} produce blank- or zero-fill of
a word containing a Cray file name, 7 characters left-justified
with zero- or blank-fill. The initial contents of characters
8-10 are ignored. Filling operates right to left, replacing
zero (blank) by blank (zero) until the first non-zero
(non-blank) character is found.
\par
{\tt FNNUM} acts as do-nothing if the parameter
is already a file-name. If the parameter is an integer $n$ with
$0 < n < 99$, the routine interpretes $n$ as a logical unit number
and converts it to the file name {\tt TAPEn} with zero-fill.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprograms \\
User Entry Names: \Rdef{FNBLAN}, \Rdef{FNZERO}, \Rdef{FNNUM}
\Usage
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL FNBLAN(NAME)
\end{verbatim}
creates blank-fill in {\tt NAME} as described above.
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL FNZERO(NAME)
\end{verbatim}
creates zero-fill in {\tt NAME} as described above.
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL FNNUM(NAME)
\end{verbatim}
converts logical unit number {\tt NAME} to a CDC file name as described
above.
\Notes
For {\tt FNBLAN} and {\tt FNZERO} the initial content of {\tt NAME}
must be a file name, not a logical unit number.
