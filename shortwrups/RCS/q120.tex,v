\Cernhead {High Level Interface to Graphics and Zebra}
The {\tt HIGZ} package is part of {\tt PAW} (Q121) (Physics Analysis
Workstation), but can be used independently.
{\tt HIGZ} contains entries which look and act like many of the entries
of {\tt GKS} (Graphics Kernel System) and, in addition, has
entries providing a higher level of functionality such as plotting
whole histograms. {\tt HIGZ} also contains an option to create a device
independent metafile stored in {\tt ZEBRA} (Q100) format which can
hence be ported, and re-interpreted, on other machines and operating
systems.
\par
The complete {\tt HIGZ} facilities are available in the {\tt PAW}
(Q121) system.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprograms
\Usage
See {\bf Long Write-up}.
