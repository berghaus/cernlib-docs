\Cernhead{Volume of Intersection of a Circular Cylinder with a Sphere}
Function subprograms {\tt RVNSPC} and {\tt DVNSPC} calculate the volume
of intersection $V(r,\rho,d)$ of a circular cylinder of radius
$r \geq 0$ with a sphere of radius $\rho \geq 0$, the distance from
the center of the sphere to the axis of the cylinder being $d \geq 0$.
\par
This volume is given by
$$ V(r,\rho,d) \ = \ \displaystyle
2 \int\!\!\!\int \sqrt{\rho^2-x^2-y^2} \, dx dy, $$
where the integration is performed over the intersection, if any,
of the two circular disks $(x-d)^2 + y^2 \leq r^2$
and $x^2 + y^2 \leq \rho^2$.
If $r \neq 0 \wedge \rho \neq 0 \wedge d < r+\rho$ this is equal to
$$ V(r,\rho,d) \ = \ \displaystyle
4 \int_{\max(d-r,-\rho)}^{\min(d+r,\rho)}
\int_0^{\min \left( \sqrt{r^2-(x-d)^2},\sqrt{\rho^2-x^2} \right)}
\sqrt{\rho^2-x^2-y^2} \, dx dy. $$
Otherwise $V(r,\rho,d) = 0$.
\par
On CDC and Cray computers, the double-precision version {\tt DVNSPC}
is not provided.

\Usage
In any arithmetic expression,
\begin{center}
{\tt RVNSPC(R,RHO,D)} \quad or \quad {\tt DVNSPC(R,RHO,D)} \quad
has the value \quad $V(\mathtt{R,RHO,D})$.
\end{center}
{\tt RVNSPC} is if type {\tt REAL}, {\tt DVNSPC} is of type
{\tt DOUBLE PRECISION}, and {\tt R}, {\tt RHO} and {\tt D} are of the
same type as the function name.
\Method
The integral given above can be expressed in closed form in terms of
complete elliptic integrals of the first, second, and third kind.
For details see Ref. 1.
\Notes
Any negative sign in the parameters is ignored.
\par
In the single-precision version {\tt RVNSPC} on machines other than
CDC or Cray, the complete elliptic integrals are calculated
inside the subprogram. This version, faster than {\tt DVNSPC},
is intended mainly for applications in experimental physics, where its
limited accuracy of about 6 digits can be tolerated.
