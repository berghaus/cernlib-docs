\Cernhead {Sort Rows of a Matrix}
{\tt SORTMQ} rearranges the row order of a matrix in such a way that the
elements of a selected column are either in increasing or decreasing
order, as desired. Row orders are not necessarily preserved in case
these elements are equal.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprogram  \\
User Entry Names: \Rdef{SORTMQ}\\
External References: \Rind{USWOP} (V303)
\Usage
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL SORTMQ(MX,NC,NR,NCS)
\end{verbatim}
performs an ordering operation on the matrix {\tt MX},
dimensioned {\tt (NC,NR)}, using the {\tt NCS}-th elements
of each row as ordering criterion.
\par
The matrix {\tt MX} is stored by rows, the first element of a row
following immediately after the last element of the preceding row.
\par
Obviously, $\mathtt{1 \leq |NCS| \leq NC}$ is a condition. If
this is not met, or if $\mathtt{NR \leq 1}$, {\tt SORTMQ} will do
nothing.
\par
If $\mathtt{NCS > 0}$, {\tt SORTMQ} reorders the rows of {\tt MX} in such a
way that the {\tt NCS}-th element of each row is $\geq$ the {\tt NCS}-th
element of the preceding row. If $\mathtt{NCS < 0}$, the rows of {\tt MX}
are reordered in the strict reverse order to that for $\mathtt{NCS > 0}$.
\Source
Based on an Algol procedure described in Ref. 1.
