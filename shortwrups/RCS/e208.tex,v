Please note that this routine has been obsoleted in CNL 218. Users are
advised not to use it any longer and to replace it in older programs.

Subroutine {\tt LSQ} fits a polynomial of degree $m-1$ to $n$
equally-weighted data points ($x_i,y_i$). The computed coefficients
$a_j$ of the fitted polynomial have values which minimize
$$\sum^n_{i=1}\left( y_i-\sum^m_{j=1}a_jx_i^{j-1} \right) ^2.$$
For the case $m=2$ (straight line fit), subroutine {\tt LLSQ} is
faster and easier to use than {\tt LSQ}.
\par
Meaningful results can usually be obtained only for small values
of $m$ (typically less than 10).

\Usage

\begin{DLtt}{12345678}
\item[N] ({\tt INTEGER}) Number $n$ of data points.
\item[X] ({\tt REAL}) One-dimensional array. {\tt X(i)} must be equal
to the data coordinate $x_i$, \\ $(i=1,2,\ldots,\mathtt{N})$.
\item  [Y] ({\tt REAL}) One-dimensional array. {\tt Y(i)} must be equal
to the observed value $y_i$, \\  $(i=1,2,\ldots,\mathtt{N})$.
\item[M] ({\tt INTEGER}) On entry, {\tt M} must be equal to the number
$m$ of coefficients of the polynomial to be fitted. On exit, the value of
{\tt M} may differ from this (see {\bf Error Handling}).
\item[A] ({\tt REAL}) One-dimensional array. On exit from {\tt LSQ},
{\tt A(j)} is equal to the coefficient of $x^{j-1}$ in the fitted
polynomial, $(j=1,2,\ldots,\mathtt{M})$.
\item[A1,A2] ({\tt REAL}) On exit from {\tt LLSQ}, {\tt A1} and {\tt A2}
are equal to the coefficients of the fitted straight line $a_1+a_2 x$.
\item[IFAIL] ({\tt INTEGER}) On exit from {\tt LLSQ}, {\tt IFAIL}
is equal to {\tt -2} if $\mathtt{N < 2}$, to {\tt -1} if the matrix of
normal equations is numerically singular, and to zero otherwise.
\end{DLtt}
\Method
Normal equations.
\Errorh
Error {\tt E208.1:}  $\mathtt{M<1}$ or $\mathtt{M>N}$ or
$\mathtt{M>20}$ (subroutine {\tt LSQ}). {\tt M} is replaced by zero.\\
Error {\tt E208.2:}  The normal equations matrix is numerically singular
(subroutine {\tt LSQ}).\\
For each error, a message is printed unless subroutine
{\tt KERSET (N001)} has been called.
\Notes
On computers other than Cray and CDC double-precision arithmetic is used
internally.
