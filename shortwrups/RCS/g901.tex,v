\fbox{\parbox{120mm}{\OBSOLETE
Please note that this routine has been obsoleted in CNL 215. Users are
advised not to use it any longer and to replace it in older programs.
No maintenance for it will take place and it will eventually disappear.

Suggested replacement: {\tt RAN3D} (V130) }}
\end{center}
These subroutines generate random points uniformly distributed on
the circumference of a circle ({\tt RAN2VS} and {\tt VRAN2S})
or on the surface of a sphere ({\tt RAN3VS} and {\tt VRAN3S});
i.e., 2- or 3-dimensional random vectors of specified length.
\Structure

\Usage
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL RAN2VS(RADIUS,X,Y)
    CALL RAN3VS(RADIUS,X,Y,Z)
    CALL VRAN2S(RADIUS,N,X,Y,R)
    CALL VRAN3S(RADIUS,N,X,Y,Z,R)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{DLtt}{12345678}
\item [RADIUS] ({\tt REAL}) Radius of the circle (sphere), with
centre at the origin, on which {\tt RAN2VS} and {\tt VRAN2S}
({\tt RAN3VS} and {\tt VRAN3S}) will calculate one or more points.
\item [N] ({\tt INTEGER}) Number of random points required.
\item [X,Y,Z] ({\tt REAL}) On exit, these contain the Euclidean
coordinates of the random point(s). In the case of {\tt VRAN2S} and
{\tt VRAN3S}, {\tt X}, {\tt Y}, {\tt Z} must be arrays of at least
{\tt N} elements.
\item [R]({\tt REAL}) Array of at least {\tt N} elements, required
as working space.
\end{DLtt}
\Method
{\tt RAN2VS} initially computes a random point $(x_1,y_1)$ uniformly
distributed over the interior of the square $-1 < x_1,y_1 < +1$,
using two calls to {\tt RANF} (G900). If this point lies outside the unit
circle $x_1^2 + y_1^2 \leq 1$ it is discarded and the process
is repeated until a point $(x_1,y_1)$ lying inside the unit circle
is found. The output point {\tt (X,Y)} is then the projection of
($x_1,y_1$) from the origin onto the circumference of the
specified circle.
\par
{\tt RAN3VS} proceeds similary, using a cube instead of a square.
\par
{\tt VRAN2S} and {\tt VRAN3S} apply the same method to generate
{\tt N} points at each call.
\Source
These subroutines are based on a similar subroutine {\tt RAN3D} (V130)
written by F. James.
