\Cernhead {Deflate Matrix with Known Eigenvalue/Eigenvector}
Given a matrix of order $n$ and an eigenvalue and a corresponding
eigenvector (both real) the routines {\tt DEFL}, {\tt DEFLS} and
{\tt DEFLSS} compute a deflated matrix, i.e. a matrix of order $n-1$
with the same eigenvalues as the given matrix except for the known
eigenvalue. The eigenvectors will in general not be the same.
\begin{DLtt}{12345678}
\item[DEFL] expects no special properties of the input matrix except
that it is real and has a known real eigenvalue and eigenvector.
\item[DEFLS] is written for symmetric real matrices.
\item[DEFLSS] expects the input matrix to be symmetric and stored in a
one-dimensional array as described below.
\end{DLtt}
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprograms \\
User Entry Names: \Rdef{DEFL}, \Rdef{DEFLS}, \Rdef{DEFLSS}\\
Internal Entry Names: {\tt SKAL}
\Usage
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL DEFL  (A,N,NDIM,EIGVAL,EIGVEC)
    CALL DEFLS (A,N,NDIM,EIGVAL,EIGVEC)
    CALL DEFLSS(A,N,EIGVAL,EIGVEC)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{DLtt}{12345678}
\item [A] ({\tt REAL}) The input matrix. In the first two cases {\tt A}
is a two-dimensional array, but for {\tt DEFLSS}, {\tt A} is
one-dimensional and should contain the elements {\tt A(1,1)},
{\tt A(2,1)}, {\tt A(2,2)}, {\tt A(3,1)},\ldots,{\tt A(N,N)},
stored in that order. On return, {\tt A} will contain the deflated
matrix.
\item [N] ({\tt INTEGER}) Order of the matrix {\tt A}.
\item [NDIM] ({\tt INTEGER}) First dimension parameter of {\tt A} in the
calling program.
\item [EIGVAL] ({\tt REAL}) The known eigenvalue.
\item [EIGVEC] ({\tt REAL}) One-dimensional array containing the
eigenvector corresponding to {\tt EIGVAL}.
\end{DLtt}
\Method
Householder transformations.
\Notes
The user should be aware of the fact that the accuracy of the deflated
matrix depends on the accuracy of the given eigenvalue and eigenvector.
