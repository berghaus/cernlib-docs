Please note that this routine has been obsoleted in CNL 215. Users are
advised not to use it any longer and to replace it in older programs.
No maintenance for it will take place and it will eventually disappear.

{\tt RN32} generates random numbers uniformly distributed in the
interval (0,1). It produces exactly the same {\tt REAL} numbers on all
computers of word length at least 32 bits. On CDC, the lower 28 bits are
always zero. The generator is of the usual multiplicative congruential
type with a 'good' multiplier (69069). It gives good results for short
sequences but is not recommended for delicate calculations involving
more than $10^6$ random numbers.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprogram  \\
User Entry Names: \Rdef {RN32}, \Rdef{RN32IN}, \Rdef{RN32OT}\\
External References: \Rind{IAND}{M441}
\Usage
The generator {\tt RN32} does not require initialisation, but it can be
started or restarted with a given 'seed' if desired.
\begin{verbatim}
    X = RN32(DUMMY)
\end{verbatim}
generates a random number {\tt X} of type {\tt REAL}.
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL RN32IN(IX)
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt IX} (type {\tt INTEGER}) must be an odd integer of at least 5
decimal digits, $\mathtt{\leq 21474836647}$, sets a starting seed equal
to {\tt IX}.
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL RN32OT(IX)
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt IX} where of type {\tt INTEGER}, returns the current value of
the seed in {\tt IX}.
\Method
The default value of the starting seed is {\tt 65539}.
The multiplicative congruential method is used to generate a series of
31-bit integers by multiplying the previous integer by {\tt 69069} and
keeping only the lower 31 bits. This is then converted to a {\tt REAL}
number by first masking off the lower 8 bits to assure that the
conversion can be done exactly on a machine with 32-bit word length,
floating the resulting integer and multiplying by the float of $2^{-31}$.
