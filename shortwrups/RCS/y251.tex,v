\Cernhead {HPLOT : HBOOK Graphics Interface for Histogram Plotting}
{\tt HPLOT} is a {\tt FORTRAN}-callable facility for producing
{\tt HBOOK} (Y250) output on all kind of graphic devices.
The output is of a quality suitable for publications.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprograms
\Usage
A full description of the system is given in the {\bf HIGZ-HPLOT}
Manual (Q120, Y251).

{\tt HBOOK} (Y250) output on graphic devices such as pen plotter,
Tektronix T4012 storage tube display etc. The output is of a quality
suitable for publications.
\par
Many options are available such as:
\begin{DLtt}{12}
\item[$\bullet$] A3 or A4 plotter output;
\item[$\bullet$] Placing several histograms side by side on the same
picture;
\item[$\bullet$] Superimposing histograms;
\item[$\bullet$] Comments and titles of axis.
\end{DLtt}

See {\bf Long Write-up}, but note that
although {\tt HPLOT} uses {\tt GD3} (J510), this is transparent to the
user.
\Notes
The package can easily be implemented on machines other than CDC, even
if {\tt GD3} does not exist on that machine. The Implementation Guide,
available from the Documentation Office, should be consulted.
