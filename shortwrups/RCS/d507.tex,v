\Cernhead {A Fitting and Plotting Package Using MINUIT}
{\tt Mn\_Fit} is an interactive fitting and plotting package,
that uses {\tt MINUIT} to fit histograms or data read in
from a file and displays the fit results on a screen.
Many functions are built into the package and it is
easy for the user to add new ones. Fitting of
1-D and 2-D histograms is possible, and you can
also fit several histograms simultaneously
and apply constraints on the function parameters.
Likelihood fitting is built-in and can also
take into account limited Monte Carlo statistics.
Hardcopies of pictures can easily be made with a
quality suitable for publication. {\tt Mn\_Fit} can also be
used purely as a plotting package without using the
fitting.
