\Cernhead {COMIS - Compilation and Interpretation System}
The {\tt COMIS} package is part of {\tt PAW} (Q121) (Physics Analysis
Workstation), but can be used independently. It is a Fortran
interpreter with which the user can interactively define, edit and
execute any Fortran routines without recompiling and relinking. A small
user interface system is part of {\tt COMIS} and an interface with the
local editor is also provided.
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprograms
\Usage
See {\bf Long Write-up}.
