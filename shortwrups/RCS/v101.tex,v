\fbox{\parbox{120mm}{\OBSOLETE
Please note that this routine has been obsoleted in CNL 215. Users are
advised not to use it any longer and to replace it in older programs.
No maintenance for it will take place and it will eventually disappear.

Suggested replacement: {\tt RNORML} or {\tt RNORMX} (V120) }}
\end{center}
{\tt NORRAN} generates a pseudo random number with normal (Gaussian)
distribution, zero mean and unit variance. {\tt NORRAN} is much faster
than {\tt RANNOR} (V100).
\Structure
{\tt SUBROUTINE} subprogram  \\
User Entry Names: \Rdef{NORRAN}, \Rdef{NORRIN}, \Rdef{NORRUT}\\
Internal Entry Names: {\tt UNI},{\tt VNI} (IBM only)
\Usage
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL NORRAN(RANDOM)
\end{verbatim}
returns {\tt RANDOM} (type {\tt REAL}) as a pseudo random number in
Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance. The value
returned in any particular call to {\tt NORRAN} is statistically
independent of earlier values. The sequence of values returned in
subsequent calls is, however, functionally dependent on a 'seed'
(two 'seeds' on 32 bits machines) which the user can extract or set as
follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL NORRUT(SEED1,SEED2)
\end{verbatim}
{\tt SEED1} and {\tt SEED2} (on CDC and Cray {\tt SEED1} only)
(type {\tt REAL}) will be replaced by the current values (value) of the
internal 'seeds' ('seed') in {\tt NORRAN}.
\begin{verbatim}
    CALL NORRIN(SEED1,SEED2)
\end{verbatim}
{\tt SEED1} and {\tt SEED2} (on CDC and Cray {\tt SEED1} only)
(type {\tt REAL}) replaces the current values (value) of the internal
'seeds' ('seed') in {\tt NORRAN}.
\Method
CDC: See Ref. 1. IBM: See Ref. 2.
\Notes
{\tt NORRUT} and {\tt NORRIN} are called with two arguments,
the second of which is unused (dummy) in the CDC and Cray versions of
{\tt NORRAN}. {\tt NORRIN} should only be called with arguments set by
a previous call to {\tt NORRUT}. While {\tt NORRAN} may function from
arbitrary seed(s) its random behaviour may be unpredictable unless this
restriction is observed.
